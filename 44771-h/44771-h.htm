<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>The author has no apology to offer for the
production of this book. He has spent his life
in environments that have brought him into
constant contact with mechanics, artisans and
laborers as well as professional men, engineers,
chemists and technical experts of various types.
He knows a great many men&mdash;young men, for
the most part&mdash;are constantly working on the
old, old problem of Perpetual Motion; that
much money, and much time are being spent in
search of a solution for that problem which all
scientific and technical men tell us is impossible
of solution.</p>

<p>It is believed by the author that a classification
and presentation of selected groups of
the devices produced in the past by which it was
by the inventor believed, self-motive power had
been attained, will save much work in fields
already thoroughly exploited.</p>

<p>So far as the author knows no book on the
subject has appeared since 1870. The various
encyclopedias published contain articles on the
subject, but they are necessarily brief, and not
satisfying to young men who have become interested
in the subject.</p>

<p>In 1861, Henry Dircks, a civil engineer, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
London, published a work entitled "Perpetuum
Mobile; or, Search for Self-Motive Power, During
the Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth
Centuries." The book contains 599
pages, and was followed in 1870, by a second
series by the same author entitled "Perpetuum
Mobile, or a History of the Search for Self-Motive
Power from the Thirteenth, to the
Nineteenth Century." In these two books
there is amassed a wonderful amount of material
showing on the part of the author diligence,
great patience and wide and thorough
search.</p>

<p>The author of these works was not enamoured
of his subject, and his books clearly
show that he was not writing them because of
any interest he had in the subject of Perpetual
Motion. On the contrary, they appear to have
been written because of a deep detestation entertained
by the author for the subject of Perpetual
Motion, and a contemptuous pity for
any one seriously interested in the subject.
Mr. Dircks's works may be said to be the works
of a scold. His sentiments were deep, and his
impulses strong, which accounts for the vast
amount of labor he did in the preparation of
his books. Those books are now out of print,
and it is believed by the author of this book
that they may well remain so. They contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
much material that no one would be justified
in wading through. The most complicated
mechanisms devised by enthusiastic dreamers
are shown in the same detail with which the
inventors described them in presenting them
to the public, or to the patent offices. Little is
to be gained by this.</p>

<p>So complicated are many of the devices
that only technically trained engineers could
read them understandingly, and few technically
trained engineers are now greatly interested
in self-motive power devices. We believe that
every useful or interesting purpose is served if
enough devices are collected, classified and presented
to show the various principles relied
upon by the inventors; with an explanation of
why they failed&mdash;i. e., wherein the principles
relied upon are wrong, and while possibly not
out of harmony with any mechanical principles
then known, are entirely out of harmony with
principles since discovered and now well
known.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this volume a vast
amount of the information furnished by the
two works of Mr. Dircks has been rearranged,
reclassified, and used.</p>

<p>Everyone who has to any extent, by environment,
associated with the mass of people
who are not technically educated, knows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the persons who are still interested in the subject
of Perpetual Motion, and who still seek its
attainment, are not technically trained engineers
or mathematicians, but for the greater part
untrained people of naturally strong mechanical
sense, and of natural mechanical and
mathematical adaptation.</p>

<p>This book is written for the perusal of that
large class of people. It is not designed as an
argument either for or against the possibility
of the attainment of Perpetual Motion.</p>

<p>The author is content to classify and
present&mdash;clearly, it is hoped&mdash;the leading endeavors
that have been known in that field of
effort, and to explain their failure.</p>

<p>It is believed by the author that the perusal
of the present volume by anyone whose mind
has been attracted by the subject of Perpetual
Motion will result in an enlightenment, and,
it is also believed, will have a tendency to direct
his mind from a struggle with theories
long ago exploded, and may result in directing
his efforts to things practical, and not without
hope of attainment.</p>

<p>This work is offered only to minds mechanically
or mathematically inclined. It is not
even hoped that it will interest people who
prefer fiction to fact, nor people who read simply
for idle entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_ESSAY" id="INTRODUCTORY_ESSAY">INTRODUCTORY ESSAY</a></h2>

<p>Perpetual Motion as used in this book is
to be taken in its conventional, and not in its
strict literal sense. The strict literal analysis
of the two words implies unceasing motion.
Of this we have many illustrations&mdash;the tides,
the waves of the ocean, the course of the earth
around the sun, and in the movements of all
heavenly and astronomical bodies. In fact, it
is difficult to conceive in a strictly scientific
sense of any substance having an entire absence
of motion.</p>

<p>Perpetual Motion as used in this book
means what it is usually understood to mean&mdash;Self-Motive
Power&mdash;a machine that furnishes
the power to keep its parts going as a machine.
In this sense Perpetual Motion has
always engaged the minds of many, many people&mdash;and
what is more natural? As soon as a
boy begins to take an interest in moving parts
of machinery, vehicles, locomotives, and what
not, he perceives that the application of power
results in the motion of bodies, and again that
bodies in motion are productive of power. A
wheel moved by muscular, or other mechanical
power, is made by machinery to elevate water,
and elevated water can be made in descending
to run machinery. The windlass, or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
wheel, turned by applied force, lifts buckets
from wells&mdash;raises stone, and elevates heavy
bodies, if desired. Heavy bodies descending
can be, and are used through means of machinery
to make machinery run.</p>

<p>A great many similar illustrations could
be given. What, then, is more natural than
that a boy with an active mind who is at all
mechanically turned, as most boys are, begins
to wonder why, if wheels lift stones, and if
stones descending make wheels run, cannot a
machine be made that will lift stones, or other
weights, and in turn be run by the descent of
the lifted stones, or other weights? Why, if
the turning of wheels lift water, and if descending
water makes wheels go, should not an
adaptation be made by which the same machine
will elevate water, and be run by the descent
of the elevated water?</p>

<p>That it cannot be done is now the consensus
of opinion of all technically trained
mechanics, but, that it can not be done, and why
it can not be done, is sure not to occur to the
boy, nor to the man who has only a strong
natural mechanical sense to guide him, and has
not the advantage of technical training.</p>

<p>Again, it is well known that many, many
men have spent considerable sums of money
and given hours and hours, and days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
months, and years of close and careful thought,
and experiment to the production of a machine
that will accomplish Perpetual Motion, and
that many have announced to the world that
they had succeeded in its accomplishment, but
that all their devices so far have turned out
failures.</p>

<p>It is to no purpose to tell the Perpetual
Motion worker that he is seeking to attain the
impossible; that the attainment of self-motive
power has been demonstrated to be an impossibility.
He will answer, or, at least, he will
reason to himself that many things once pronounced
impossibilities and claimed to be so
demonstrated, have since been attained. The
Perpetual Motion worker is usually a person
of active intelligence, and being enamoured of
mechanical projects is likely to read extensively
along mechanical lines, and knows as every
well-informed person knows, that there are
many instances in the history of the discovery
and development of the most important mechanical
inventions and scientific discoveries
where the persistent efforts of so-called enthusiastic
dreamers and cranks finally triumphed
over the settled and conventional "impossibilities"
of dignified scientists.</p>

<p>When, less than a century ago, it was
proposed to propel a ship across the Atlantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
ocean by steampower, Ignatius Lardner, a
scientific teacher, lecturer and interpreter of
real note and merit wrote a book "demonstrating"
the physical impossibility of a vessel carrying
enough fuel to propel itself through that
distance of water. The book was actually
printed, but was scarcely off the press until the
first steamship had successfully crossed the
Atlantic with steampower, and steamed triumphantly
into port.</p>

<p>After communication by electric telegraph
was well established and had been in successful
commercial use for decades, it was proposed to
converse by long distance over a wire. The
idea was hooted and declared impossible, and
it did seem so, and yet today, there is scarcely
a farm house in the nation but what has an
instrument by which the occupants can talk
over wires not only to their near-by neighbors,
but to remote cities.</p>

<p>Prof. Samuel P. Langley, less than two
decades ago undertook in a thoroughly scientific
manner to accomplish what is called
"heavier than air flight." His scientific ideas
on the subject were entirely correct, but he
did not have the advantage of engine refinement
as it is known today, by which high
energy development can be attained with an
engine or motor of small weight. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Prof. Langley succeeded in flying a considerable
distance, and in fact, made a number
of successful demonstrations of the <i>physical
possibility</i> of heavier than air flight. Prof.
Simon Newcomb, who is to be ranked as the
greatest astronomer, mathematician and scientist
the United States has ever produced, and
with the possible exception of Benjamin Franklin,
the most original thinker along scientific
lines, wrote an article which was published
generally in scientific journals, in which he
warned Prof. Langley of the folly of his attempts,
not claiming, however, the scientific
impossibility of heavier than air flight, but
claiming that it could never be of any real practical
value; that the instability of the air, etc.,
limited flight by man to a daredevil show performance.
A child then born would now be
scarcely grown, and yet, aeroplanes are in use
in every civilized country in the world for observation
and military purposes, and even for
carrying mail to places not otherwise easily
accessible.</p>

<p>Thousands of flights are undertaken every
day with the confident expectation of a successful
trip and return. How many, many
boys and mechanics, prior to the achievement
of human flight, have been attracted by the
problem, only to have their ambitions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
dreams discouraged and suppressed by being
told that the scientific world knows that human
flight is impossible&mdash;"God made man to walk
on the ground, and the birds to fly, and if
Nature had intended that we should fly we
would have been equipped with wings," and
probably to be dubbed "Darius Green," as a
reminder of the inglorious fate of the pseudo
hero of that name in Trowbridge's clever and
immortal poem about Darius Green and his
Flying Machine.</p>

<p>The announcement of the discovery of
rays by means of which views may be made
and photographs taken through substances
supposedly opaque to all light rays was scouted
as a ridiculously visionary dream; but the discoverers
were not dismayed by scout and
ridicule, but persisted in their dreams and enthusiasm.
There is not a village of any considerable
size in the civilized world but has
its X-Ray Machine by which foreign substances
in the flesh may be viewed and photographed
and located with exactitude, fractures examined
and all surgical operations aided to the
benefit and health and recovery of the sick and
wounded. Mankind is the recipient of the
benefits resulting from the fact that enthusiastic
cranks were not deterred by ridicule and
supposed demonstrations of their folly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
The above are only a few of the many like
instances recorded in scientific progress. While
not accurately true, and while less true during
the last two decades than formerly, it is, nevertheless,
a general truth that scientific progress
has been made in spite of, and in the face of
discouragement and ridicule from the multitudes
who were destined to be benefited by
the discoveries made by the persistent so-called
cranks.</p>

<p>These facts are all well known to the Perpetual
Motion enthusiast. It is, therefore, of
no avail to tell him that the scientific world
has pronounced his aspirations and attempts
but dreams, and that Perpetual Motion workers
are by the scientific world denominated
cranks.</p>

<p>If it be admitted that Perpetual Motion is,
as scientific men tell us, a chimerical dream, it
is still to be very greatly doubted if the world
at large is to be benefited by dissuading minds
from working on the problem. There is no
doubt that many persons who have become
more intensely interested in mechanics by
thinking and working on the problem of Perpetual
Motion, have thereby been lead to study
more and more generally into mechanical subjects,
and became not merely tyros, but useful
men in various mechanical pursuits. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
doubtless have followed mechanical subjects to
which they were introduced by labors toward
Perpetual Motion, to the making of useful and
valuable inventions and discoveries.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that a countless
number of devices for the attainment of Perpetual
Motion have been proclaimed and exhibited,
it is to be supposed that those actually
proclaimed and brought to light constitute but
an infinitesimally small proportion of those
actually made. It is to be supposed that the
Perpetual Motion worker has some sense, and
that the great majority of them before proclaiming
his apparatus would want to know
himself that it was not a failure, and would not,
when ushered before the public, bring upon
him humiliation and jeers. It is to be believed
that in nearly every instance the produced device
was tested before being proclaimed and
ushered into the light of day. It goes without
saying that all that were so tested were failures,
and were never heard of except by the
inventor and a very few intimate friends or
co-laborers. Those that have been heralded
to the world represent only that small proportion
where over-confidence in the operation, or
a disregard for the truth, or some other unexplainable
something caused the inventor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
his friends to make the announcement and disclosure
of the device before the test.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to conceive of a
person of any intelligence exposing himself to
the ridicule resulting from the failure of a
pompously heralded device, when a simple test
would have saved the exposure, and yet the
civilized world has been filled with Perpetual
Motion devices proclaimed and heralded with
trumpet blast, which, when tested, "didn't
work."</p>

<p>It is not, however, the purview, or purpose
of this book, to incite people to work on the
problem of Perpetual Motion, neither is it its
purview or purpose to dissuade them from it.</p>

<p>In the works of Mr. Dircks, mentioned in
the preface of this work, the devices for Perpetual
Motion are classified somewhat with
reference to the time each was produced. In
some instances with reference to whether or
not patents were applied for and obtained, or
as to the source of information concerning
them.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the devices presented
in Mr. Dirck's two works, and of those,
information concerning which has been obtained
elsewhere, leads the author to believe
that nothing is to be gained by an attempted
classification along those lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
In countless instances Perpetual Motion
seekers of different races and living in separate
countries, and, indeed, on different continents,
centuries apart, have sought the attainment of
Perpetual Motion by practically the same devices,
and inventor after inventor has brought
forth alleged inventions depending upon precisely
the same underlying mechanical principle.</p>

<p>The author has attempted to classify the
various devices presented in this book according
to the underlying mechanical principles
upon which the inventor chiefly relied for the
success of his invention. Even this classification
is extremely difficult and not well distinguished.
Many of them, indeed most of
them, depend for their success upon more than
one mechanical principle, and the classifications
thereby inevitably intermingle and overlap
what otherwise would be their distinguishing
boundaries. Still it is believed by the author
that it is the best that could be adopted, and
that no better or clearer classification is possible
than the one here presented.</p>

<p>The various devices are classified by the
author under the following heads:</p>

<p>Devices by Means of Wheels and Weights.</p>

<p>Devices by Means of Rolling Weights and
Inclined Planes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

<span class="subhead">DEVICES BY MEANS OF WHEELS AND
WEIGHTS</span></h2>

<h3>Wilars de Honecort</h3>

<p>While attempts at Perpetual Motion are
as old as the human race, not many of the more
ancient devices have been preserved, either by
engraving or by explanation.</p>

<p>Among the very earliest of these attempts
of which we have detailed information is the
device of Wilars de Honecort. He was an
architect, and lived in the thirteenth century.
The information is preserved in "A Sketch
Book" by him which was deposited and remains
in the Ecole des Chartes at Paris. About
the middle of the nineteenth century comments
were published in France on this ancient device.
Some of these were translated into English.
The following account is an extract from a
translation made by Professor Willis, of Cambridge.</p>

<p>"<i>Many a time have skilful workmen tried to
contrive a wheel that shall turn of itself: here is a
way to make such a one, by means of an uneven
number of mallets, or by quicksilver.</i>"</p>

<p>Wilars de Honecort presents to us a device<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
for a perpetual motion; it is not clear
whether he intends to claim the contrivance of
it, or whether he had met with it in the course
of his travels. It differs very little from a well-known
contrivance for this purpose which has
been so often published, and its fallacy so fully
explained in popular books, that it is unnecessary
to dwell at length upon the mechanical
principles which it involves. It is extremely
curious in this place, because it shows the great
antiquity of the problem, the solution of which
has wasted the time, the brains, and the means
of many an unhappy artisan or philosopher.</p>

<p>In the drawing we have now before us, the
two upright posts, which are framed together
and skilfully braced so as to ensure their steadiness,
support between them a long horizontal
axle, to the center of which is fixed a wheel
with four spokes. The absence of perspective
in this drawing makes the wheel appear as if
it were parallel to the frame, instead of being,
as it is, at right angles to it.</p>

<div id="if_i_024" class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;"><img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="289" height="308" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Seven mallets, or arms, each loaded with
a heavy weight at the end, are jointed at equal
distances to the circumference of the wheel, so
that those which happen to have their joints
below the diameter of the wheel will hang
freely down, but if the wheel be turned round by
hand or otherwise, the weights of those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
are on the ascending side will, in succession,
rest on its circumference, and will, in that position,
be carried over the highest part of the
wheel and downwards on the descending side,
until the arms that bear them are brought into
a vertical position and a little beyond it, and
then the weight will fall suddenly over and rest
on the opposite position on the circumference of
the wheel, until its further descent enables it
to dangle freely as before. The effect of this
mechanism upon the position of the weights
is not truly represented, for the upper mallet
has fallen over too soon. In the modern form
of this contrivance a pin, or stop, is introduced,
by which the mallet, when it falls over, is compelled
to rest so that its arm shall point to the
center of the wheel, and thus the descending
weight be held at a greater distance from the
center than when ascending. It is extremely
probable that this difference is a mere error of
the artist, for the drawing has the appearance
of having been made from a model of the wheel
at rest; a condition in which, of course, it would
always be found, unless moved by some external
force. The inventor seems to have
thought that the action above described would
always place four weights on the descending
side, and leave but three on the ascending side,
each weight as it rises to the top being intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
to leap suddenly over to the descending side,
in the manner just explained; or perhaps, as
M. Lassus suggests, the contriver imagined
that the blows given to the wheel in succession
by the falling mallets would help it forward.
It is surprising that although the slightest
model would show the failure of devices of this
class to persons incapable of mathematical reasoning,
yet such machines have been seriously
proposed in books, and are continually recontrived
by ingenious workmen. The allusion
to quicksilver in the manuscript shows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Wilars was acquainted with the well-known
contrivance described in the books already referred
to, in which portions of that metal inclosed
in channels are used instead of the falling
weights.</p>

<h3>A Repetition of Wilars de Honecort's Plan</h3>

<p>This device was brought forth in 1831 in
England, and illustrates what we say in the
Introductory Essay to the effect of inventors
working on the same plan in different parts of
the earth and centuries apart.</p>

<div id="if_i_025" class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;"><img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="336" height="335" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
We are unable to give the inventor's name.
He was a correspondent to Mechanics' Magazine,
and the description furnished by the inventor
as published in Mechanics' Magazine,
is as follows:</p>

<p>Description.&mdash;A A A is a ring of thin wood;
B B B, several spokes, movable round the fixed
points C C C, and only allowed to move one way
by the construction of the openings D D D;
E E E, heavy weights fixed to the ends of the
spokes.</p>

<p>From the position in which the wheel is at
present, it is evident that the weights on the right-hand
side (1 and 2) acting at a greater distance
from the center than those (4 and 5) on the other
side, will cause that side to descend until the spoke
1 reaches the position 3, when it will exert no
moving influence, but by which time the weight 8
will have fallen into the position 1, when a similar
effect will take place, and so on with the rest.</p>

<h3>Leonardo da Vinci</h3>

<p>It is with a mingled feeling of sorrow and
exaltation that we note the Perpetual Motion
labors of the great Leonardo da Vinci. Of all
of the men who ever gave the subject more
than a passing notice he is the most famous.</p>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian, born in
1452, and died in 1519. He was the illegitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
son of Florentine, lawyer. His mother has
been variously described as a peasant, and as
of gentle birth. Little about her is known.
The father belonged to a family of lawyers,
and never repudiated the son, but took him,
educated him, and cared for him. It is well
for the world that he did, for Leonardo da Vinci
has perhaps contributed more to art and learning
in the world than any other single individual
that ever lived. He was a painter, a sculptor,
an architect, a musician, a mechanician,
engineer and natural philosopher. Each subject
in art or science that he touched he not
only mastered, but improved and embellished.
He painted the original of the well-known picture
of the Christ and His twelve Apostles,
known as the "Last Supper," or the "Last Supper
of Our Lord." This, and Mona Lisa, are
perhaps the paintings by which he is known to
the greatest number of people, and are considered
by many connoisseurs the highest perfection
in art ever attained by mortal man.</p>

<p>But, as painter and sculptor, he is to be
regarded as among the greatest, if not the very
greatest that ever lived. In art he ranks beside,
if not ahead of Michelangelo and Raffael,
and yet they are known only as artists, while
he was preeminent in both art and science. The
work he did in natural science was entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
original and emanated from an inherent initiative
and originality, and as a scientist, he is
entitled to rank below only Newton, Gallileo
and Copernicus, and very few others. In all
the history of the world he is the only man of
whom it can be said that he attained the apex
of eminence in both art and science.</p>

<p>The information concerning Leonardo da
Vinci's devices for obtaining Perpetual Motion
is extremely meager. There does not seem to
be extant any detailed explanation of just how
he expected his different designs to work.</p>

<p>All that is known concerning his efforts
is sufficiently illustrated by the following cuts
and language from Dircks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fig. 1 may be taken as a scheme belonging
to the fifteenth century. It seems to be placed
at the head as a simple or elementary design
for future improvement. It is a chambered
drum wheel, containing balls or weights, which,
being always farthest from the center on one
side, as compared to the other, are expected to
keep the wheel constantly rotating.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. Failing in this scheme, the inventor
next offers one with weighted levers, which
are to fall outwards on one side, but to fall inwards
on the opposite side, the weight at the
same time sliding up the lever when vertical
at the bottom, so as to be nearer the center
throughout on the ascending side. But how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the weight is to be made to ascend <i>at the bottom</i>
remains to be shown.</p>

<div id="if_i_029" class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="347" height="600" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Fig. 3. The difficulty of elevating the
weight would appear to have suggested its immersion
in a trough of water, as here shown.
The weights seem to be attached to some contrivance
to float them <i>upwards</i>; but we are perplexed,
and so no doubt was da Vinci, how to
sink them, or being sunk, how to render them
again buoyant by any self-motive process.</p>

<p>Fig. 4. It would appear as though the difficulties
observable in Fig. 3 were attempted
to be met here, in a plan which evidently combines
several views of the case, yet without
removing the main difficulty; for although the
weight at the end of the long arm may be quite
capable of sinking in the liquid, we still inquire,
How is it ever to be raised again?</p>

<p>Fig. 5 seems to be an incomplete sketch,
and a mere variation on the preceding designs,
with the addition either of machinery below to
be worked by it, or to give it motion. Possibly
it was proposed to have a magnet at the bottom
of the vessel.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 appears to be two designs in one
sketch. On one side we have long single
levers, with a single weight at their ends, and a
weight between each at the periphery; on the
other end, double or forked levers and double
weights. Its mixed character renders it probable
that it was merely some preliminary
sketch.</p>

<p>The great value of the present exhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of these early contrivances of misdirected mechanical
ingenuity consists in the convincing
evidence which they afford, that all young inventors
who occupy themselves in the search
for self-motive machines, do little more than
reproduce the blunders of a past age. After a
lapse of five centuries modern inventors often
become patentees of contrivances which are
only more complicated than the assumed-to-be
overweight wheel of Wilars de Honecort, or
the six similar ones of Leonardo da Vinci.
But such has hitherto been the ignorance of
mechanics on this subject, that Fig. 1 of the
annexed diagrams has frequently been adduced
by writers on the subject, as the veritable wheel
invented by the Marquis of Worcester, in the
seventeenth century!</p></blockquote>

<h3>A. Capra's Device</h3>

<p>In 1678, A Capra, of Italy, revived the ancient,
but still favorite scheme that dates back
to the 13th century. (See page 22 ante.) He
illustrates his idea with the following figure
and the following comment:</p>

<p>On the wheel A (of the facsimile engraving
opposite), which must be hung well equipoised
between two uprights, are appended
counter-weights, eighteen in number, all precisely
at the same distance from each other,
and all exactly of the same weight. The counter-weights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
are provided with a small ring by
which they are hung.</p>

<div id="if_i_032" class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="339" height="410" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Whilst the counter-weights B are farther
from the center C of the wheel, they weigh
more than the counter-weights I, because these
are low and nearer to the center C of the wheel,
so that the counter-weights B descend and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
weight I drops; and whilst the weight B is alternately
descending and the weight I ascending,
the wheel will revolve continually. But
it must be understood that it is necessary to
make the wheel perfectly true in equilibrium,
so that it do not weigh more on one side than
on the other on account of the counter-weights.</p>

<h3>The Device of Dixon Vallance. England, 1825</h3>

<p>This inventor was certain he had overtaken
and captured the ever-illusive Perpetual
Motion. He gives a description of his happiness
and his machine in the following effusively
joyous language:</p>

<blockquote>

they remain till, by the revolution of the wheel,
they are allowed to roll out to the circumference.

<h3>Furman's Device</h3>

<p>Strange as it may seem, the patent office
of the U. S. government as late as 1884 and
1886, received and filed, seriously considered
and granted Letters Patent on Perpetual Motion
Devices as appears from the description of
Furman's Device following, and from Schirrmeister's
"Mechanical Movement," and Enbom
&amp; Anderson's "Improvement in Pumps," appearing
on pages 38 and 76 respectively, supra.</p>

<p>These were not denominated Perpetual
Motion Devices by the inventors, but the specifications
show them to be simply that and
nothing more.</p>

<p>July 15, 1884, George H. Furman, of
Rochester, Ohio, U. S. A., was granted U. S.
Patent No. 301979, on</p>

<p class="center">

<p>The essentials are sufficiently shown by
the following excerpt from the specifications

placed in the outer drum, F, through the door
<i>f</i>, the machine being at rest, they will accumulate
at the lower part of the drum F in the
pockets <i>c´ c´</i>. Now, to run the machine a person
will apply his hands to the rim H and revolve
the outer drum, F, in the direction of the
arrow shown in Fig. 1. This movement of the
outer drum will cause the weights <i>d</i> to be carried
in the pockets <i>c´ c´</i> to the upper side of the
drum, at which point they will roll from the
pockets <i>c´ c´</i> into the pockets <i>b b</i> of the inner
drum, G, where their weight will cause the drum
G and shaft E to revolve. <i>As the pockets</i> b <i>of
the inner drum pass below the shaft E they empty
the weights into the troughs</i> c´ <i>of the outer wheel,
F, to be again carried above the shaft and dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
into the pockets</i> b, <i>so that the inner wheel, G, and
shaft E will be revolved continuously.</i></p></blockquote>

<h3>Schirrmeister's Mechanical Movement</h3>

<p>July 6, 1886, Charles Schirrmeister, of
Brooklyn, Kings County, State of New York,
U. S. A., obtained Letters Patent No. 345077,
on a new and useful</p>

<p>"Mechanical Movement."</p>

and the following figures accompanying

<p>The object of my invention is to furnish a
cheap and simple <i>means for imparting mechanical
power</i>; and I accomplish this by means of
a series of radial arms placed at right angles to
and projecting from the axis of motion where
power is first applied, and so arranged that each
arm is in a different vertical plane, said arms
being weighted at each end with a ball of metal.
Some of these arms are also made hollow and
inclose sliding or rolling weights, which move
back and forth as the axis revolves, and the motion
is still further re-enforced by a series of
springs which are attached to the axis by a
lever and eccentric.</p>

<p>Taking the simplest form of my device, I
illustrate the same by the accompanying drawings,
in <span class="locked">which&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Figure 1 is a side elevation of the entire
apparatus. Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing
the hollow arm with a rolling weight. Fig. 3
is an end view showing the operation of a re-enforcing
spiral spring. Fig. 4 is a detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
view showing still further the method of re-enforcing
motion by springs. Fig. 5 is a view
of the driving-pulley with its hollow arms.</p>

<p>Similar letters refer to similar parts in the
several views.</p>

<p>A is the axis to which the power first imparting
motion is applied.</p>

<p>N are the bearings supporting the same.</p>

<p>B is the driving-pulley attached to said
axis, and from which motion is imparted by
means of the driving belt <i>b</i> to any point desired.</p>

<p>C are the hollow arms of the driving-pulley
B.</p>

<p>D are the solid arms radiating from the
axis A.</p>

<p>E are the hollow arms radiating from the
axis A.</p>

<p>F are the solid balls or weights secured to
the ends of the arms D and E.</p>

<p><i>a</i> are the sliding or rolling weights, which
are inclosed within the hollow arms C and E.</p>

<p><i>c</i> are the slots cut into the hollow arms E,
to relieve the air-pressure formed by the backward
and forward motion of the weights <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>G are springs so arranged as to expend
their force upon the axis A by means of the
connecting rods H, both attached to the springs
and one attached to the axis A by means of the
eccentric I and the other to the wheel J at one
end of the axis.</p>

<p>K is a balanced lever, upon which the
springs G may rest, said lever being supported
at each end upon the springs L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
M is a crank attached to one end of the
axis A, and serves to show the place and manner
in which the power may be applied.</p>

<p>The manner of constructing and operating
my invention is as follows: The entire apparatus
is made of steel or iron, and the shaft,
bearings, arms, springs and connecting-rods
are of ordinary form. The main or driving
pulley is cast with four hollow arms, in which
round weights are inclosed, which move back
and forth within the arms when the wheel is
set in motion. The solid arms, as well as the
hollow arms, which are used in addition to
those forming a part of the driving-pulley, are
arranged by means of set-screws a suitable distance
apart upon the axis and in different perpendicular
planes, so as to give steadiness in
motion. A thread is cut upon each end of these
arms, and the fixed weights are then screwed
on. When the shaft or axis revolves, the
weights which move toward the ends of the
arms above the center accelerate the motion,
and the momentum of the machine aids in overcoming
the resistance caused by the weights,
which are below the center. At the same time
the revolution of the eccentric and crank-pin
upon the axis depresses the connecting-rods,
which in turn depress the springs, which, being
released as soon as the eccentric and crank-pin
have reached their lowest point, contribute a
lifting power to overcome the resistance above
mentioned. As shown in the drawings, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
springs joined to the connecting-rods may be
supported and assisted by other springs.</p>

<p>The power is applied by hand, operating
upon a crank at the end of the axis, or may be
imparted by steam, hot air, electricity, or in
any other known method, and is conducted to
any desired point by means of the belt <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Having fully described my invention, what
I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters
Patent, is:</p>

<p>1. The combination, in apparatus for increasing
mechanical power, of an axis, as A,
supported upon bearings N, with a driving-pulley,
as B, having hollow arms, as C, with
movable weights, as <i>a</i>, and radial arms, both
solid and hollow, the latter having movable
weights, together with fixed weights attached
to the end of each arm, all substantially as and
for the purpose described.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Ferguson's Device</h3>

<p>James Ferguson was an eminent Scotch
mechanician and astronomer. He was born in
1710, and died in 1776. He was reared in very
humble circumstances, and is known as the
Peasant Boy Philosopher. A most interesting
story of his life was written by Henry Mayhew,
and published in England in 1857, entitled
"The Story of the Peasant Boy Philosopher."</p>

<p>He prepared astronomical tables of great
value and lectured on astronomical and mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
subjects. His lectures were edited by
a no less eminent man than Sir David Brewster.</p>

<div id="if_i_043" class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;"><img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="352" height="332" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>While Perpetual Motion seemed to have received
considerable time and attention from him,
and while his writings show that he examined a
great many mechanical devices, he seems all the
time to have entertained serious doubt of the possibility
of a machine having self-motive power.
However, in 1770, he devised a machine for the
purpose of producing Perpetual Motion. It
does not appear that he ever offered the machine
to the public, or sought publicity for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
A description of it is to be found in his Common
Place Book in the University Library, Edinburg.
The description there furnished is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The axle at A is placed horizontally, and
the spokes B, C, D, etc., turn in a vertical position.
They are jointed at <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, etc., as a common
sector is, and to each of them is fixed a
frame as R, S, T, etc., in which the weights
7, 8, 9, 1, 2, etc., have liberty to move. When
any spoke as D is in a horizontal position, the
weight I in it falls down and pulls the part <i>b</i>
of the then vertical spoke B straight out, by
means of a cord going over the pulleys K and
k to the weight I. The spoke C <i>c</i> was pulled
straight out before, when it was vertical, by
means of the weight 2, belonging to the spoke
E <i>e</i> which is in the horizontal position D <i>d</i>; and
so of all the others on the right hand. But
when these spokes come about to the left hand,
their weights 4, 5, 6 fall back, and cease pulling
the parts <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>; so that the spokes then
bend at their joints X, <i>y, z</i>, and the balls at
their ends come nearer the center A, all on the
left side. Now, as the balls or weights at the
right hand side are farther from the center A
than they are on the left, it might be supposed
that this machine would turn round perpetually.
I have shown it to many who have declared
it would; and yet for all that, whoever
makes it, will find it to be only a mere balance.
I leave them to find out the reason.</p></blockquote>

<h3>B. Belidor's Device</h3>

<p>This device was incubated in the brain of
an American. His name is unknown. We
have denominated it "B. Belidor's Device," not
because B. Belidor was the inventor, but because
the account of the invention was furnished
by him. This device seems to the author
to have possessed originality, though, of
course, it failed to work for reasons clearly
apparent.</p>

<div id="if_i_045" class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;"><img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="322" height="329" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>An account of it was given in the Journal
of Franklin's Institute, Philadelphia, in 1828.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
The article contributed by B. Belidor is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even the pursuit after perpetual motion,
hopeless as it is, may not be considered entirely
vain, in occasionally leading to useful
modifications of machinery. As an instance of
this, I here submit to you a plan suggested by
an ingenious friend of mine, several years ago,
as in the diagrams annexed, Fig. 1, a perpendicular,
and Fig. 2 a horizontal view.</p>

<p>A A, two vertical wheels, placed diagonally,
and revolving on the axes X X. The
levers B B and C C are hinged at the peripheries
of the wheels. By rotation the arms B B are
projected from the center of motion, while the
arms C C are drawn in.</p>

<p>It is plain that a series of arms as shown
in Fig. 2, will produce an eccentric motion,
causing the weights at their ends apparently
to preponderate on the side B.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Belidor.</span></p></blockquote>

<h3>Desagulier's Proposition on the Balance</h3>

<p>This so-called problem is of doubtful classification.
The author of the problem did not
claim that the discovery of the problem discloses
any means for attaining Perpetual Motion,
and, yet, it is apparent that if the author
of the problem was correct in his solution of it,
Perpetual Motion was thereby already within
his grasp. The difficulty about it all is that
while the problem is quite interesting, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
author's solution shows that he was not familiar
with even fundamental mechanics. The
name of the author was J. T. Desagulier, LL.D.,
F. R. S. He was a minister of the gospel, but
evidently gave considerable attention to mechanical
questions. He is mentioned in chapter
X of this work.</p>

<p>Rev. Desagulier presented two problems
of the balance. One he calls "A Proposition on
the Balance, not taken notice of by Mechanical
Writers, explained and confirmed by an Experiment."
The article under this heading is
as follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_048" class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;"><img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="504" height="346" alt="" /><br /></div>

<blockquote>

<p>In the last papers I published in "Philosophical
Transaction" against this perpetual motion,
described in No. 177, I intreated the author to
permit me to say nothing as to what alterations he
might make in his engine, resolving to leave it
to others to show him that upon that principle
all he can do signifies nothing. But I
find since, in the "Nouvelles de la Republique"
for December last, that he still persists to urge
some new contrivances, which being added, he
conceives his engine must succeed. To this I
answer, that I undertook only to shew that his
first device would faile, which yet I should
scarce have done if I had thought a dispute of this
nature could have lasted so long. To come,
therefore, to the point where he saith that this
engine may well succeed without alteration,
because he hath tryed with liquors put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
bellows immersed in water; I again say that I
grant him the truth of the experiments, but
deny the consequences he would draw from
them. I have already given the reasons of my
dissent, which this gentleman is not pleased to
understand. But to end all controversies, he
may please to consult Mr. Perrault, De la Hire,
or any other at Paris well known to be skilled
in hydraulicks, and I doubt not but he will find
them of the same opinion with Mr. Boyle, Mr.
Hook, and other knowing persons here, who all
agree that our author is in this matter under a
mistake.</p>

<h4>A Proposition on the Balance, not taken notice
of by Mechanical Writers, explained and
confirmed by an Experiment.</h4>

<p>A B is a balance, on which is supposed to
hang at one end, B, the scale E, with a man in
it, who is counterpoised by the weight W hanging
at A, the other end of the balance. I say,
that if such a man, with a cane or any rigid
straight body, pushes upwards against the
beam anywhere between the points C and B
(provided he does not push directly against B),
he will thereby make himself heavier, or overpoise
the weight W, though the stop G G hinders
the scale E from being thrust outwards
from C towards G G. I say likewise, that if
the scale and man should hang from D, the
man, by pushing upwards against B, or anywhere
between B and D (provided he does not
push directly against D), will make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
lighter, or be overpoised by the weight W,
which before did only counterpoise the weight
of his body and the scale.</p>

<p>If the common center of gravity of the
scale E, and the man supposed to stand in it,
be at <i>k</i>, and the man, by thrusting against any
part of the beam, cause the scale to move outwards
so as to carry the said common center of
gravity to <i>k</i> <i>x</i>, then, instead of B E, L <i>l</i> will
become the line of direction of the compound
weight, whose action will be increased in the
ratio of L C to B C. This is what has been
explained by several writers of mechanics; but
no one, that I know of, has considered the case
when the scale is kept from flying out, as here
by the post G G, which keeps it in its place, as
if the strings of the scale were become inflexible.
Now, to explain this case, let us suppose
the length B D of half of the brachium
B C to be equal to 3 feet, the line B E to 4 feet,
the line E D of 5 feet to be the direction in
which the man pushes, D F and F E to be respectively
equal and parallel to B E and B D,
and the whole or absolute force with which the
man pushes equal to (or able to rise) 10 stone.
Let the oblique force E D (= 10 stone) be resolved
into the two E F and E B (or its equal
F D) whose directions are at right angles to
each other, and whose respective quantities
(or intensities) are as 6 and 8, because E F and
B E are in that proportion to each other and to
E D. Now, since E F is parallel to B D C A,
the beam, it does no way affect the beam to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
move it upwards; and therefore there is only
the force represented by F D, or 8 stone, to
push the beam upwards at D. For the same
reason, and because action and reaction are
equal, the scale will be pushed down at E with
the force of 8 stone also. Now, since the force
at E pulls the beam perpendicularly downwards
from the point B, distant from C the whole
length of the brachium B C, its action downwards
will not be diminished, but may be
expressed by 8 × B C; whereas the action upwards
against D will be half lost, by reason of
the diminished distance from the center, and
is only to be expressed by 8 × B C/2; and when
the action upwards to raise the beam is subtracted
from the action downwards to depress
it, there will still remain 4 stone to push down
the scale; because 8 × B C - 8 × B C/2 = 4 B C.
Consequently, a weight of 4 stone must be
added at the end A to restore the æquilibrium.
Therefore a man, &amp;c., pushing upwards under
the beam between B and D, becomes heavier.
Q. E. D.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if the scale should hang
at F, from the point D, only 3 feet from the
center of motion C, and a post G G hinders the
scale from being pushed inwards towards C,
then, if a man in this scale F pushes obliquely
against B with the oblique force above mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the whole force, for the reasons before
given (in resolving the oblique force into two
others acting in lines perpendicular to each
other) will be reduced to 8 stone, which pushes
the beam directly upwards at B, while the same
force of 8 stone draws it directly down at D
towards F. But as C D is only equal to half
of C B, the force at D, compared with that at
B, loses half its action, and therefore can only
take off the force of 4 stone from the push upwards
at B; and consequently the weight W
at A will preponderate, unless an additional
weight of 4 stone be hanged at B. Therefore,
a man, &amp;c., pushing upwards under the beam
between B and D, becomes lighter.</p></blockquote>

<p>The other problem presented by Rev.
Desagulier is denominated by him "An Experiment
explaining a Mechanical Paradox,
that two bodies of equal weight suspended on a
certain sort of balance do not lose their equilibrium
by being removed, one farther from, the
other nearer to, the center."</p>

<p>The article concerning this problem is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the two weights P W hangs at the ends
of the balance A B, whose center of motion is
C, those weights will act against each other
(because their directions are contrary) with
forces made up of the quantity of matter in
each multiplied by its velocity; that is, by
the velocity which the motion of the balance
turning about C will give to the body suspended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Now, the velocity of a heavy body is
its perpendicular ascent or descent, as will appear
by moving the balance into the position
<i>a b</i>, which shews the velocity of P to be the
perpendicular line <i>e a</i>, and the velocity of B
will be the perpendicular line <i>b g</i>; for if the
weights P and W are equal, and also the lines
<i>e a</i> and <i>b g</i>, their momenta, made up of <i>e a</i>
multiplied into W, and <i>b g</i> multiplied into P,
will be equal, as will appear by their destroying
one another in making an equilibrium. But
if the body W was removed to M, and suspended
at the point D, then, its velocity being
only <i>f d</i>, it would be overbalanced by the body
P, because <i>f d</i> multiplied into M would produce
a less momentum than P multiplied into <i>b g</i>.</p>

<div id="if_i_053" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="500" height="450" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>As the arcs A <i>a</i>, B <i>b</i>, and D <i>d</i>, described by
the ends of the balance or points of suspension,
are proportionable to their sines <i>e a</i>, <i>g b</i>, and
<i>d f</i>, as also the radii or distances C A, C B, and
C D; in the case of this common sort of balance,
the arcs described by the weights, or their
points of suspension, or the distances from the
center, may be taken for velocities of the
weights hanging at A, B, or D, and, therefore,
the acting force of the weights will be reciprocally
as their distances from the center.</p>

<p>Scholium.&mdash;The distances from the center
are taken here for the velocities of the bodies,
only because they are proportionable to the
lines <i>e a</i>, <i>b g</i>, and <i>f d</i>, which are the true velocities;
for there are a great many cases wherein the
velocities are neither proportionable to the distances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
from the center of motion of a machine,
nor to the arcs described by the weights or
their points of suspension. Therefore, it is not
a general rule that weights act in proportion
to their distances from the center of motion;
but a corollary of the general rule that weights
act in proportion to their velocities, which is
only true in some cases. Therefore, we must
not take this case as a principle, which most
workmen do, and all those people who make
attempts to find the perpetual motion, as I have
more amply shewn in the Phil. Trans., No. 369.</p>

<p>But to make this evident even in the balance,
we need only take notice of the following
experiment:&mdash;A C B E K D is a balance in the
form of a parallelogram passing through a slit
in the upright piece N O standing on the pedestal
M, so as to be moveable upon the center
pins C and K. To the upright pieces A D and
B E of this balance are fixed at right angles the
horizontal pieces F G and H I. That the equal
weights P W must keep each other in æquilibrio,
is evident; but it does not at first appear
so plainly, that if W be removed to V, being
suspended at 6, yet it shall still keep P in
æquilibrio, though the experiment shews it.
Nay, if W be successively moved to any of the
points 1, 2, 3, E, 4, 5, or 6, the æquilibrium will
be continued; or if, W hanging at any of those
points, P be successively moved to D, or any
of the points of suspension on the cross-piece
F G, P will at any of those places make an
æquilibrium with W. Now, when the weights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
are at P and V, if the least weight that is
capable to overcome the friction at the points
of suspension C and K be added to V, as u, the
weight V will overpower, and that as much at
V as if it was at W.</p>

<p>From what we have said above, the reason
of this experiment will be very plain.</p>

<p>As the lines A C and K D, C B and K E,
always continue of the same length in any position
of the machine, the pieces A D and B E
will always continue parallel to one another,
and perpendicular to the horizon. However,
the whole machine turns upon the points C and
K, as appears by bringing the balance to any
other position, as <i>a b e d</i>; and therefore, as the
weights applied to any part of the pieces F G
and H I can only bring down the pieces A D
and B E perpendicularly, in the same manner
as if they were applied to the hooks D and E,
or to X and Y, the centers of gravity of A D
and B E, the force of the weights (if their
quantity of matter is equal) will be equal, because
their velocities will be their perpendicular
ascent or descent, which will always be as the
equal lines 4 <i>l</i> and 4 L, whatever part of the
pieces F G and H I the weights are applied to.
But if to the weight at V be added the little
weight <i>u</i>, those two weights will overpower,
because in this case the momentum is made up
of the sum of V and <i>u</i> multiplied by the common
velocity 4 L.</p>

<p>Hence follows, that it is not the distance
C 6 multiplied into the weight V which makes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
momentum, but its perpendicular velocity L 4
multiplied into its mass. Q. E. D.</p>

<p>This is still further evident by taking out
the pin at K; for then the weight P will overbalance
the other weight at V, because then
their perpendicular ascent and descent will not
be equal.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Desagulier was evidently a
man of scientific turn and capacity. It is unusual
to find ministers deeply interested in scientific
matters, and yet, he seems to have been. The net
result of his experiments can be succinctly stated
as follows:</p>

<p>In the first problem there is <i>no change in
the distance of the center of gravity from the
support</i>, and, therefore, there could be no disturbance
of the equilibrium.</p>

<p>In the second problem there <i>is a change in
the distance in the center of gravity from the
support</i>, and there must have been a disturbance

<h3>Explanation of the Failure of the Preceding
Wheels and Weights Devices</h3>

<p>It must not be presumed that the preceding
devices shown in this chapter constitute any considerable
part of the Wheels and Weights Devices
that have been constructed through the hope of
attaining Perpetual Motion. Of all the means
whereby Perpetual Motion has been sought
wheels and weights have been by far the most
prolific. There is scarcely a village or a rural
community in the civilized world that cannot
point out its Perpetual Motion worker, and
he generally starts with wheels and weights,
though often, after long labor and final failure
with wheels and weights, he still exploits other
attractive fields of hopeless endeavor. Of the
devices of that kind, accounts of which have appeared
in scientific journals, or application for
patents upon which have been made, and, indeed,
patents often granted, it would be possible
to write a book of thousands of pages, but to do
so would be to no purpose.</p>

<p>It is believed by the author that the preceding
devices are sufficient to illustrate, and show
the controlling features of all the various mechanical
contrivances for the utilization of wheels
and weights as a means of Self-Motive Power.
Countless others could be shown of more or less
complicated mechanism, but an examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
would disclose the fact that each gets back to
some combination of parts well illustrated in the
preceding. Also, in endeavoring to express why
all wheels and weights devices have failed to
work, each essential point of weakness is disclosed
in the preceding. Now, why have they
failed to work, and wherein are they inherently
wrong and unscientific?</p>

<p>A cursory examination of the preceding devices
shows that each depends ultimately on the
supposition:</p>

<p>1. That a descending weight elevates an
equal weight through a distance equal to the
descent, and at the same time overcomes the frictional
resistance of mechanism, both ascent and
descent being measured on perpendicular lines, or</p>

<p>2. That weights affixed to an axis and
caused to have a longer leverage on the descending
side than on the ascending side, and consequently
the downward pull on the long lever side
is supposed to be greater than the downward pull
or resistance on the short lever side of the axis.</p>

<p>If the fallacy of these supposed principles is
explained and fully understood, it disposes, and
disposes effectually, of the possibility of obtaining
Perpetual Motion by means of wheels,
weights and the force of gravity.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that a wheel is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
lever, or rather it is a continuous series of levers&mdash;nothing
more&mdash;nothing less.</p>

<div id="if_i_062" class="figcenter" style="width: 209px;"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="209" height="264" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>We first refer to the figure shown in A.
Capra's device, page 33 ante. The left side of
this wheel is, of course, supposed to be the descending
side on which the weights are farthest
from the center of the wheel. It is apparent that
only five weights are having any leverage advantage
whatever, while a much greater number are
being made to ascend. The advantage which a
few of the weights have by virtue of the leverage
pulling downward is always exactly counterbalanced
by an <i>increased number</i> of weights being
drawn upward. It should be borne in mind that
the direction of the force of gravity is toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the center of the earth, and not in the direction
of the motion of the wheel, except at the extreme
left side of the wheel.</p>

<p>Again, consider the figure appearing on
page 63. It is manifest that the weights on the
right hand are further out, and have a leverage
advantage of the weights on the left hand
side, but it is also manifest that there is, and always
must be, a greater <i>number</i> of weights on
the left hand side. The <i>greater leverage</i> of the
weights on one side is exactly balanced by the
greater number of weights on the other side.</p>

<p>For a further illustration, take the figure
shown on sheet 65, ante. The weight "1" has a
distinct advantage over weight "5." Weight "2"
has a distinct advantage over weight "6." But
here we have only three weights: 1, 2 and 8, tending
to pull the wheel from left to right, whereas
there are five weights, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, tending to
prevent its going to the right.</p>

<p>In other words, if weights 1, 2 and 8 were
removed, it is clear that the wheel would turn
back to the left by reason of the action of the
weights 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Here again the <i>leverage
advantage</i> which weights have descending is
counterbalanced by the <i>increased number of
weights</i> on the opposite side acted on by the force
of gravity, tending to prevent the descent of those
having the greater leverage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<div id="if_i_064" class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;"><img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="336" height="336" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>All the simpler devices failed, of course, to
work. The more complicated devices are simply
efforts to overcome the elementary principles that
prevented the simpler devices from working.
Among these that of Dixon Vallance (see page
34, ante), is best adapted to illustrate the folly
and the fallacy of these various devices to overcome
elementary principles.</p>

<p>We here refer to the figure appearing on
page 35, ante, shown in connection with Dixon
Vallance's Device. The obvious purpose was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
keep all the weights close to the hub, except those
depended upon to produce continuous motion by
their greater leverage.</p>

<p>To the untrained and untechnical person it
would perhaps not be manifest at first just why
the Vallance machine failed to work. Here is
its failure: Weight "c" must be raised toward the
hub of the wheel. To raise that weight requires
the application of force. That force must be
supplied. The belt "cc" would work more freely
if it were not elevating a weight, and the force
required from "w" to turn the wheel so as to
elevate the weight at "c" is counterbalanced by
the resistance the weight "c" offers to being
raised, and consequently to the motion of the belt
and in turn to the progress of the wheel.</p>

<p>It should always be remembered that, omitting
friction, the energy exerted by a descending
body is the <i>perpendicular distance</i> of its descent
multiplied by its weight. For, notwithstanding
what its course may be from an elevated point to
a lower point the energy accumulated in the descent
is still the product of the perpendicular distance
and the mass, or weight.</p>

<p>In all of these devices it is apparent that
every weight is brought back by some force from
the lowest point it reaches to the same elevation
from which it started to descend. It is axiomatic,
therefore, that the perpendicular ascent is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
equal to the perpendicular descent. The ascending
weight and the descending weight are, of
course, the same. Therefore, the product of the
weight and the perpendicular distance of <i>ascent</i>
is exactly equal to the product of the weight and
the perpendicular distance of <i>descent</i>. Hence,
there is an exact balancing of energies, and no
motion results. Any motion imparted by wind,
water or steam will, if the moving force be withdrawn,
soon be overcome by unavoidable friction,
and a state of rest follows. There can be no
doubt that any attempt to attain Self-Motive
Power by means of wheels, weights, levers, and
the force of gravity must result in failure. The
thing itself is physically impossible.</p>

<p>In addition to what is above stated, read
carefully Chapter XI, on Conservation of Energy;
also read Chapter XIV, entitled "The
Seeming Probability of Effecting a Continual
Motion by Solid Weights in a Hollow Wheel or
Sphere" at page 290 of this book.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEVICES BY MEANS OF ROLLING
WEIGHTS AND INCLINED PLANES</span></h2>

<h3>Device by Mercury in Inclined Glass Tube and
Heavy Ball on Inclined Plane</h3>

<p>Neither the inventor's name nor his nativity
can we give. An account of the invention was
furnished by a correspondent to Mechanics'
Magazine in 1829. The account is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the curious who delight in mechanical intricacies,
to whom ingenuity of contrivance is the
goal for which they run, nothing seems to afford
and require such endless resources as that most
puzzling thing&mdash;perpetual motion. The unfortunate
name "perpetual motion," if changed for
"mechanical experiment," would eventually, perhaps,
remove the real cause of censuring it, by the
different idea of the object aimed at.</p>

<p>I now beg leave to offer some account of a
combination of movements, which, from its originality,
and seeming to possess every requisite for
retaining it in action, may possibly be acceptable.</p>

<div id="if_i_068" class="figcenter" style="width: 204px;"><img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="204" height="173" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>This diagram shows a side view. On the
stand A are raised two supports B, each having
a center hole at <i>a</i>, to receive the axle of the balanced
apparatus, consisting of C, a glass tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
containing a portion of mercury G; and D, a
grooved scaleboard, in which a ball, E, can roll
backwards and forwards. F F are two jointed
levers, which are to serve, when struck by the
ball, to reverse the position of the compound balance:
the whole centred at <i>a</i>, the tube at <i>b</i>, and
the grooved board at <i>c</i>. In its present position,
the mercury (it is supposed), having flowed to
the end C, will depress D, and cause the ball E
to roll to D, and depress the end G F D; and so
on continually.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Series of Inclined Planes</h3>

<p>This scheme is of English origin, and was
promulgated in 1864. The name of the inventor
is unknown, but he described his invention in a
communication to a scientific publication in the
following language:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The accompanying diagram represents a
series of inclined semi-tubes connected together
in the form of a rectangle.</p>

<div id="if_i_069" class="figcenter" style="width: 167px;"><img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="167" height="125" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The ball A, is placed at the top of an incline
in such a position that it shall descend to B, at
which point it will have sufficient velocity or
gravity to carry it up the ascent to C; and so supposing
the inclines and ascents to be endless, the
repetition of the movement must be also endless.
I think it is not unreasonable to suppose that a
perpetual movement of the ball will take place,
from the fact that the velocity imparted to it by
its <i>first</i> descent is sufficient to carry it from A to
C, <i>those two points being at the same level</i>. I
think the only thing to guard against is the ball
rushing over the point C, and thus accelerating
the velocity at each descent. The incline on road
upon which the ball runs can be made either circular,
square, octagonal, or, in fact, almost of
any form.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Device by Oscillating Trough and Cannon
Balls</h3>

<p class="center">(Name of inventor unknown)</p>

<p>An adaptation from a "Perpetual Pump"
substituting cannon-balls for water.</p>

<p>An account of this invention was published
in London in 1825, in the language of the inventor,
who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The description of the perpetual pump has
suggested to me whether the long-sought "perpetual
motion" may not be found by a simple mechanical
alteration of that machine, and substituting
a cannon-ball as a <i>primum mobile</i>, in lieu
of the water, not always obtainable. I would
recommend that in the bottom of the trough be
inserted at each end two dropping-boards, of a
triangular form, moving on an axis at one corner,
one of which falling below the level of the trough
at the elevated end, the other shall be raised by
the stop affixed to the standard-post, which,
throwing the ball again back to the former end,
shall depress that, until the same process is repeated
in perpetual activity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;Fig. 1. A, the trough,
swinging on an axis at B. C, the cannon-ball,
raised by one of the dropping-boards, D, whilst
the other falls through the opening at E, into the
trough. F, the support or stop, raising the dropping-board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
D. The center of the trough ought
to be pierced, leaving the sides as a support to the
ball, which ought not to be wider than the ball
may travel freely through.</p>

<div id="if_i_071" class="figcenter" style="width: 170px;"><img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="170" height="201" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Fig. 2. D D, the dropping-boards, which
pass through the center so as to leave a sufficiency
of the trough as a resting place for the ball to
give a momentum, and depress the trough, previously
to its being again raised by the dropping-board.</p></blockquote>

<p>We meekly venture to call the attention of
this inventor, if he is still living, and to any
others who may be working along the same line,
that to our certain knowledge water is more generally
obtainable than cannon-balls. We, therefore,
suggest the use of water instead of
cannon-balls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<h3>Unpublished Incline Plane and Weights Devices
Noted by the Author</h3>

<p>Except the preceding three devices the author
does not remember ever to have seen reported
in any book, patent, application for patent,
or report, the account of a device for obtaining
self-motive power by means of weights and inclined
planes, and yet, it is believed by the author
from the use that has been made of inclined
planes and rolling weights in demonstrating mechanical
principles by many natural philosophers,
and also from devices that have from time to time
been brought to the attention of the author during
thirty years last past, that the inclined plane
with rolling weights has been a fertile field of
folly among Perpetual Motion seekers.</p>

<p>On a number of occasions the author has
been asked to view and inspect mechanical devices
of that kind, which it was claimed by the confident
inventor and his friends "would surely
work when just one little thing could be overcome."
The phraseology was sometimes varied a
little from the preceding quotation, but the substance
was always there.</p>

<p>In one instance the device attracted the enthusiastic
attention and elicited breathless interest
from a doctor and surgeon of much more than
ordinary skill and intelligence in his profession,
and was hopefully regarded by a number of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
persons who had had schooling advantages and
were supposed to be versed in the rudiments of
mechanics, and, it would seem to the author,
ought at first sight to have perceived the fallacy
and hopelessness of the inventor's dreams.</p>

<p>All of these claimed inventions relying on
the inclined plane with rolling weights were so
nearly alike in the principle involved that all may
be illustrated by the following explanation:</p>

<div id="if_i_073" class="figcenter" style="width: 160px;"><img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="160" height="147" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The above figure shows a vertical section of
a device that illustrates the controlling principle
in all of these devices. It is manifest that the
balls between A and C are hanging equally between
A D and C D, the points of suspension
A and C being in a horizontal line. It is also
manifest that there will be a greater number of
balls on the sloping incline A B than on the
sloping incline B C. The Perpetual Motion
seeker has always argued to himself that the
<i>four</i> balls between A and B should pull stronger
to the left at B than the <i>two</i> balls between B and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
C can pull. Sometimes this device has been
varied whereby the balls would roll freely down
the incline from B to A and then roll back toward
C down another incline where they would be supposed
to strike a lever and impel a ball from C
to B, which ball would then roll down the incline
B A, and so on indefinitely.</p>

<p>The error of all this lies in the fact that the
four balls between B and A will not elevate the
two balls between B and C for the reason that
they are on a less inclined slope. As we would
ordinarily state it, B C is a "steeper" incline.
One ball between B and C by force of gravity
pulls stronger toward C than one ball on B A
will pull toward A. It is manifest, therefore,
that an equilibrium requires a greater number of
balls on B A than B C.</p>

<p>B A is longer and accommodates a greater
number of balls than can be accommodated on
B C. The number of balls that can be accommodated
on the respective sides is always found
to be such that the small number of balls between
B C pull in the aggregate toward C the same as
the greater number of balls between B and A
pull toward A, and thus equilibrium is established.</p>

<p>It is manifest, therefore, that with the pull
from B toward C equal to the pull from B toward
A, the mechanism finds its balance and motion
ceases. This is true of all similar devices.</p>

<h3>Enbom &amp; Anderson's Pump</h3>

<p>"June 13, 1882 U. S. Patent, No. 259514 was
granted to Andro Enbom and John A. Anderson,
of Augusta, Kansas, U. S. A., on</p>

<p class="center">"Improvements in Pumps."</p>

<p>It seems probable that the inventors did not
suspect, and that the patent office examiners did
not discover that the device had in the claimed
"Improvement" the essentials of self-motive
power. An examination of the specifications
clearly shows, however, that the claim of the inventors
that "the water lifted by the pump is
caused in its passage over the wheel A² to give
power to the same and thus lessen the labor required,"
presupposes the principle of self-motive
power. The following figure taken from the
specifications and the following excerpt from the
specifications illustrate the intended operation:</p>

<p>The operation is substantially as follows:
By the application of power to the crank a revolution
is given to the main shaft A, and by means
of this the pump-handle is properly actuated
through the intermediate mechanism described.
The water lifted by the pump is discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
through the spout <i>e´</i> to the buckets of the wheel
<i>a</i>², and by these is delivered to the trough F. By
means of the construction described the water
lifted by the pump is caused, in its passage over
the wheel <i>a</i>², to give power to the same, and thus
lessen the labor required to produce a given result.</p>

<div id="if_i_076" class="figcenter" style="width: 354px;"><img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="354" height="273" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>We suggest to the inventors that if instead
of elevating the water to the place of discharge
E´ they discharge it at the level of the trough
"F" they will lessen the distance of elevation and
will save many times the energy that can be realized
by the descent of the water from the level
of E´ to the level of "F."</p>

<h3>Device of "Ed. Vocis Rationis"</h3>

<p>In 1831 Mechanics' Magazine printed an article
contributed by a correspondent who signed
himself "Ed. Vocis Rationis." He claimed to
have invented a very powerful Perpetual Motion
Machine.</p>

<p>His enthusiasm is as interesting as his device
is absurd. We give the article as published in
full:</p>

<div id="if_i_077" class="figcenter" style="width: 158px;"><img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="158" height="227" alt="" /><br /></div>

<blockquote>

<p>I propose to endeavor to show how my plan
of perpetual motion could be applied to practical
and useful purposes. With a view to this, I give
the prefixed sketch, with the following description
of its construction and use: Let A represent
the side-wall or gable-end of a house, from 40 to
50 feet in elevation; B, a cistern, filled with water,
having an orifice near its bottom, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
open at the top, for the ready escape of waste
water, as before; C, a reservoir, so far filled with
water as not to come in contact with the bottom
of the water-wheel D, which, being an undershot
wheel, may, of course, be of such radius as is
suitable for the power required to raise the water.
Let E be another cistern, filled with water, equal
to and provided with orifices as in cistern B, both
orifices together discharging water faster than it
escapes from the lower orifice of the cistern B;
F, two (or more, as the case may require) pumps,
or expressing-fountains, supported against the
walls by ties <i>d d</i>, and having their cylinders inserted
in the reservoir C, and their lower suckers
fixed at a little less than 32 feet above the surface
of the fluid in the reservoir C. These expressing-fountains
discharging their water into the
cistern E a trifle faster than it escapes from its
lower orifice, at an elevation of at least 33 or 34
feet above the surface of the water in the reservoir
C, will afford space for water-wheels, supported
against the wall by the upright K, say
three water-wheels, G H I, of at least eight feet
in diameter each, or two only of greater diameter.
The upper wheel G being an undershot one, if not
of greater radius than four feet, which it might
be, may have its axle fixed at an altitude of at
least 30 feet, and allowing the space of a foot
between each water-wheel for the troughs a and
b, which collect and convey the water from wheel
to wheel, will give a space of 22 feet, occupied by
the three water-wheels, leaving 10 feet for the
descent of the water by the trough <i>c</i> to the cistern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
B (which may be four or five feet in depth), and
thence to the reservoir C, which may be three or
four feet in depth; also the cistern E may be four
or five feet in depth, and all of other corresponding
dimensions <i>ad libitum</i>. To produce the motion,
remove the plugs or stoppers from the lower
orifices of the cisterns E and B; the water rushing
from the latter turns the great water-wheel
D, which works the expressing-fountains into the
upper cistern E; from the orifices of which, the
water escaping turns the undershot wheel G
(which may be of larger diameter, if required);
whence being collected by the spout <i>a</i>, it shoots
over and turns the wheel H; being collected by
the spout <i>b</i>, it turns the overshot wheel I; whence
being collected by the spout <i>c</i>, it is conveyed into
the cistern B, from thence to the water wheel D,
and, finally, into the reservoir C, from which it
is raised again by the fountains into the upper
cistern E; and so on as long as you please, or as
long as the whole keeps in repair and in good
order. The apparatus may, with facility, be
stopped for convenience at any time without fear
of derangement, because the fountains carrying
water faster than it escapes from the lower orifices,
the cisterns will be always full; and it may
be again set in motion with equal facility. With
the above proviso, it cannot stop till the prevailing
natural causes which gave it motion&mdash;viz.,
the pressure of the atmosphere and the descent of
water, which in their nature and tendency are of
themselves perpetual&mdash;shall be diverted. Thus
you may have the power, free and disposable, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
three water-wheels in perpetual motion, to be applied
to such useful purposes of machinery within
the building as its inmates may require. A supply
of water-mills might be thus provided in any
situation&mdash;in the center of the metropolis or other
large towns&mdash;in places subject to a deficiency of
rivulets suitable for mills on the common system.
Neither would there be any necessity for resorting
to rivers, or raising immense buildings upon
their banks; wherever there was a convenient
house, it might be readily appropriated with little
further expense than machinery.</p>

<h3>Böckler's Plates</h3>

<p>In 1662 George Andrew Böckler published
a work on mechanics. The work is replete with
fine drawings. Not a great deal of space is devoted
to Perpetual Motion devices, but the following
three plates which are numbered 150, 151
and 152 in his work are shown as Perpetual Motion
devices.</p>

<p>These devices do not appear to have been the
inventions of Böckler himself, but are devices
noticed by him. They are not explained with any
considerable detail.</p>

<div id="if_i_081" class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;"><img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="355" height="476" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Figure 150 is "A Water Screw," and it is
stated that the inventor intends it for a Perpetual
Motion device, and it is further stated that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
scarcely worked out his purpose. The author
states that the excellence consists in the proportion
and distribution of the wheel, balls and
weights, and says further that he does not describe
it in detail, and that it is his intention to
publish at a future time a separate treatise on
Perpetual Motion in which this and other similar
machines will be considered.</p>

<p>He gives the first as Fig. 150, "A Water Screw,"
the purpose of which is not quite so obvious
as to be understood at the first view of the
figure; for the inventor intimates that he intends
it for a perpetuum mobile. He has, however,
scarcely worked out his purpose, as we may,
nevertheless, say without any prejudice to the
inventor. Nor will we here describe how the excellence
of this work consists in the proportion
and distribution of the wheel, and the balls or
weights, because it is our intention to publish, at
a future time, a separate treatise on the perpetuum
mobile, in which we shall consider this
and several similar machines.</p>

<p>Figure 151 is "A Water Screw," having a
grindstone for cutlery. The author remarks
concerning this machine as follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_083" class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;"><img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="352" height="471" alt="" /><br /></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This machine also is intended for a perpetuum
mobile. The inventor discharges water
from the reservoir A, by the canal B, on the
water-wheel C, which turns the open screw-cylinder
D, by means of the toothed wheel E, the cog-wheel
F, the spoked wheel G, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
cylinder H, and the spoked wheel I, whilst this
spoked wheel I, catching the small cog-wheel L,
together with the cylinder M, and the handle R,
turns the small spoked wheel of the screw-cylinder
H, and the screw-cylinder itself, and thus
draws up again the water discharged from the
reservoir A through the spiral screw Q. In
order to render this machine useful, a couple of
grindstones are placed on the cylinder D. Concerning
this machine, it is particularly to be considered,
whether a sufficient amount of water can
be raised again, as has been frequently remarked
before about similar works.</p></blockquote>

<p>Figure 152 is said to represent "A Double
Water Screw, with Double Pump," and the author
observes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This machine is, on the whole, similar to the
preceding ones. The water is discharged from
the round or square reservoir A, by B, on the
water-wheel C. A continual supply of water for
the water-wheel is provided as follows: The
crown wheel H is fixed on the upright cylinder
M, and is turned by the revolutions of the cylinder,
whilst it turns at the same time the upper
wheel L, which, acting on the spokes of the double
screw K, K, draws up sufficient water by I, I, and
then, as stated, discharges it by B, on the wheel C.</p>

<p>The machine may be rendered useful by furnishing
the cylinder D with the double crank E,
to drive the two pistons of the tubes F, F, which
lift the water through the pipes G, G, into the
reservoir N, whence it may be carried off for
service.</p></blockquote>

<h3>John Linley's Hydraulic Device. 1831</h3>

<p>An account of this was published in 1831 in
Mechanics' Magazine, and is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>32. Perpetual Water-wheels and Pumps
(vol. 14, 1831).&mdash;A correspondent gives a description
of a plan which he says he believes to
be entirely original, and not without considerable
claims to plausibility, thus:</p>

<div id="if_i_086" class="figcenter" style="width: 189px;"><img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="189" height="284" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Let <i>a b c d</i> represent a wooden cistern, or
trough, half filled with water; E F G, three
overshot water-wheels, supported by the upright
piece; K is another cistern, or trough,
filled with water up to the dotted lines; P is a
syphon to convey water from the lower to the
upper cistern K; R is a beam supported from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the cistern; S T U are moveable cranks attached
to the horizontal shafts through the
center of the water-wheels&mdash;each crank has a
connecting-rod to the beam R; V W are two
curved spouts to convey water from one wheel
to another. It may be well here to premise
that each water-wheel has a pump and beam,
as only one is seen in the section.</p>

<p>Now, in order to put the machine in motion,
it is only necessary to draw a portion of
water from the syphon over the wheel E, which
immediately revolves, consequently the pump
L M draws water from the lower to the upper
cistern K. Now, the water passing over the
wheel E is collected by means of the curved
spout V, and is conveyed upon the middle
wheel F, which also gives motion to another
pump, and draws in like manner. Again, the
water passing over the middle wheel, is collected
as before by another curved spout W;
consequently, the lower wheel is put in action,
accompanied with another pump. Hence it is
obvious that three water-wheels and three
pumps are worked by one stream of water from
the syphon. What more is required to perpetuate
its motion?</p>

<h3>Device of Author of the "Voice of Reason"</h3>

<p>In 1831 a contributor who signed himself
Author of the "Voice of Reason," furnished to
the scientific journals of England an account of
what he claimed was a Perpetual Motion Device<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
invented by him. It should be said to his credit
that he claimed no surplus power for his device&mdash;only
that it would run itself. He, in fact, stated
that his machine could not perform more than
the simple operation of pumping its own water.</p>

<p>The principle upon which he relied is sufficiently
shown by the following figure, and the
following excerpt from the contributed article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Observing that persons no less distinguished
than Bishop Wilkins, the Marquis of Worcester,
etc., have amused themselves with such things as
perpetual motion, it may be some apology for a
humble individual residing as I do in a very retired
part of the country&mdash;scarcely within reach
of much society&mdash;to confess that by way of a
little rational amusement and relief to the mind,
I have at times, amid a variety of other investigations
and inventions, amused myself amongst the
rest, with this of perpetual motion. The result
I will, with your permission, lay before your readers.
That I trespass upon your pages, you are
indebted to your correspondent, Mr. Linley,
whose invention I thought might partially lead
to an anticipation of one of my own, a model of
which I constructed a short time ago. The system
which first came to my mind, as likely to
lead to the accomplishment of perpetual motion,
was that of the syphon; experimenting with
which, opened discoveries that might prove useful
in hydrostatics. Amongst these was a mode of
equalizing the horizontal surface of the water in
two separate vessels of different altitudes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
following sketch will afford an idea of my invention.</p>

<div id="if_i_089" class="figcenter" style="width: 161px;"><img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="161" height="285" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Let A be a vessel, having two orifices, one at
the bottom of it, <i>a</i>, and the other open at the top
for waste water <i>b</i>, filled to the brim. B, a reservoir,
so far filled with water as not to come in
contact with the bottom of the great wheel C,
whose axle turns in the wood <i>c</i>, attached to the
side of the reservoir; <i>d</i>, a crank fixed to the axle
of the great water-wheel, which turning moves
up and down the rod <i>e</i>, attached to the beam E,
which works the pump D, having its cylinder inserted
in the reservoir B; <i>f</i>, an upright attached
to the upper vessel A, to form a support for the
beam E; the whole, together with the cylinder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the pump, being supported and tied together by
the woodwork <i>g g g</i>.</p>

<p>To produce the motion, draw the plug from
the orifice <i>a</i>, from which the water gushing out
with considerable force will immediately turn the
water-wheel, which communicating motion, by
the crank <i>d</i> and rod <i>e</i>, to the beam E, will cause
the pump D to be worked, the water from the
spout passing into the upper vessel A. Now, the
cylinder of the pump, if one only be used, must
be of suitable dimensions, or the velocity of its
movement so increased by means of a multiplying-wheel
as to enable it to discharge water into
the upper vessel A faster than the same escapes
through the lower orifice <i>a</i>; consequently, the vessel
A will soon overflow from the capacious opening
at <i>b</i>, to which a trough is attached, which collecting
the waste water, causes it to descend also
upon the circumference of the water-wheel; thus
contributing to its movement, and at the same
time tending to preserve an uniform supply of
water in the reservoir for the continued action of
the pump. Hence you have a perpetual motion,
so long as the whole keeps in repair and in good
order, which is all that can be expected of any
perpetual motion, constructed as it must be of
perishable materials.</p>

<p>But of what use are all the perpetual motion
machines, if they can perform no other work
than that of keeping themselves in motion? For
it is evident, in the case of my machine, that if I
wish to increase the power of the wheel, fixed as
it is in size, radius, etc., I must increase the jet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
water, and consequently the pumps must be made
of corresponding dimensions, or exert a corresponding
increase of force or velocity to replace
the water; so that it is evident, neither Mr. Linley's
machine nor mine, in their present fixed
state, can perform more than the simple operation
of pumping their own water.</p>

<p>And this is the case with all the perpetual
motion machines I have ever observed&mdash;they can
exert no useful or disposable power beyond that
of keeping up an equilibrium, or getting beyond
the point of equilibrium.</p>

<h3>An Italian Device</h3>

<p>In 1825 there was published in London in
Mechanics' Magazine the account of a very ancient
invention by an Italian. He had written an
account of his invention in Latin. It had been
translated and furnished to Mechanics' Magazine
by a correspondent of that Magazine. The
communication so furnished as published is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The underwritten is translated from an
ancient Latin book * * * (entitled "De
Simia Naturæ," Autore Roberto Fludd), which
treats of every science known at the time it was
published, and largely of the science of mechanics.
What followed I have extracted merely to show
that the discovery of the perpetual motion was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
nearly attained then, perhaps, as it is now.&mdash;I
am, &amp;c., P.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>Of another useful invention for raising water
easily, by the which a certain Italian ventured
to boast that he had discovered the
Perpetual Motion.</i></p></blockquote>

an exhauster, or pump.</p>

<p>B, a little wheel placed at the bottom of the
exhauster, about which pestils, or circular flaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of prepared leather, revolve lightly, so that they
rise easily: they are connected by crooked iron.</p>

<p>C C C, pestils, or circular leathers, by means
of which the water is raised in the pump.</p>

<p>D, a wheel, by which the said circular
leathers are raised up.</p>

<p>E, a pinion, moving the wheels D and B.</p>

<p>F is a wheel, continued from the wheel G,
whose teeth the pinion E propels circularly.</p>

<p>H, a pinion moving the wheel G.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Use of the Instrument.</span>&mdash;This instrument
is classed with those of the first sort, on which
account it is absolutely necessary for a multitude
of purposes, because it bears upward a large
quantity of water with the least labor; for the
number of wheels is not variable; but the length
of the receiver A is about the proportion of 35
feet, and its breadth one foot and one-third. The
concavities of it should be made exactly round,
that they may not lose any water by contracting
in their ascension; the concavity of the pump,
therefore, should be perfectly round. The great
water-wheel should be 24 feet diameter, and the
wheel G 20 feet.</p>

<p>The Italian, deceived by his own thoughts,
conceived that as much water would be raised
by this pump as would keep the wheel perpetually
in motion; because he said that more force was
required at the extremity of this machine than at
the centre; but because he calculated the proportions
of power wrong, he was deceived in practice.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Vogel's Device</h3>

<p>In 1847, A. F. Vogel, of Leipzig, invented
what he called</p>

<p class="center">"Hydrostatic General Mobile."</p>

<p>It was described at the time in a pamphlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and its operation is sufficiently illustrated by the
following annexed figure and explanation:</p>

<blockquote>

<div id="if_i_095" class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;"><img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="332" height="458" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A water-wheel, A, B, C, D, raising the water
by means of which it is to be operated. This is
effected, he supposes, by the wheel acting at A,
by the pressure of one of six pins D, on a vertical
rod, attached to a horizontal beam, working on
a centre, and its opposite end being secured to the
pump-rod of the barrel M, N. The projector has
an idea that by means of flaps, which close the
cells of the wheel as they pass under rollers at B,
while at C there is a similar contrivance to open
the flaps and let out the water, and therefore by
its retention on the descending side it will become
more effective in turning the wheel.</p></blockquote>

<h3>A Water Wheel-Driven Pump</h3>

<p>This device is claimed by the writer to be an
adaptation of Rangely's Patent Roller Pump. A
description by the writer, whose name is not
given, was published in Mechanics' Magazine,
1823, in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think it possible to produce a self-moving
power by such a machine as that, a drawing of
which is now prefixed. From its very simple construction,
a very brief description is necessary.
A represents a pump immersed in a reservoir B;
the pump is worked by the rotary motion of the
water-wheel C, which is four feet in diameter.
On the shaft of the water-wheel is the drum-wheel
D, working by a small cord the wheel E,
on the axis of the pump discharging the water by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the pipe F into a reservoir G over the water-wheel.
In this reservoir is a cock to regulate the
quantity of water to be discharged on the wheel.
The wheel on the shaft of the water-wheel being
nine inches diameter, and the wheel on the axis
of the pump three in diameter, the latter will consequently
make three revolutions for one of the
water-wheel. As the pump is not required to
turn with great velocity, the speed might be
regulated by the quantity of water thrown on
the water-wheel, the latter being four feet in
diameter, and the wheel on its shaft nine inches;
consequently the radius or arm of the wheel has
near 4½ powers to counteract the friction of the
axis of the pump and water-wheel, and of a fine
cord passed over the wheels D and E. If necessary,
the friction of the machine might be still
farther reduced by the axes of the pump and
water-wheel being made to run in gudgeons with
friction rollers.</p>

<div id="if_i_097" class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;"><img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="388" height="512" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The pipe H is intended to convey the surplus
water from the reservoir over the wheel to the
reservoir below.</p>

<p>The pump might easily be turned by a cog-wheel;
but this is unnecessary, as the cord passing
over the drum-wheels will do equally well,
and is, besides, a more simple method.</p></blockquote>

<h3>"A Journeyman Mechanic's" Device</h3>

<p>The gentleman, whose real name is unknown,
but who styled himself "A Journeyman Mechanic,"
made an invention, an account of which
appeared in "Mechanics' Magazine," in 1831. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
was an attempted adaptation of the wellknown
principles of Barker's Mill.</p>

<p>The inventor undoubtedly thought he had
successfully solved the long sought problem of
Self-Motive Power, and he benevolently and
graciously offered to contribute his valuable invention
to the world, having "no wish to profit by
monopoly."</p>

<p>We cannot but contrast the plenary benevolence
of his heart with the mechanical paucity of
his head. He describes his invention with the
following language and figure:</p>

<p>The inventor offers the accompanying
sketch, with description of an Hydraulic Mover,
for communicating power to machinery, and recently
invented by <span class="locked">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A is a hollow cylinder or pipe, forming the
upright shaft of a mill on Barker's well-known
and effective centrifugal principle.</p>

<p>B B, the lateral pipes from ditto; <i>a a</i>, the jets
of water, whose centrifugal force gives the motion.</p>

<p>C, beam to support the machinery, built at
each end into the wall D D.</p>

<p>E E, two cog-wheels to communicate the
motion to</p>

<p>P, the rod of a pump (on Shalder's principle),
which derives its supply from the well into
which the water from the pipes is conducted,
which it raises to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<div id="if_i_100" class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;"><img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="294" height="361" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>H, a cistern into which one end of a syphon,
I I, is introduced, the other end of which is
soldered with an air-tight joint into the top of
pipe A, to which it thus supplies the water which
is continually running from the pipes B B, producing
a constant motion which may be given
by carrying the horizontal rod F through the wall
D, to machinery for any purpose. And, if the
statement in the pamphlet on Hydrostatics, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,
as to the effect of Barker's Centrifugal
Mill, be correct, the power gained must be very
great.</p>

<p>The advantages of the invention are obvious.
The whole of the machinery for a large factory
may be contained underground, which, indeed,
will be the most desirable situation for it, and
valuable room will thus be saved; the expense of
erection will not be great; and the saving in coals,
&amp;c., necessary for a steam-engine of the like
powers, will be immense. I might, perhaps, have
secured much benefit to myself by taking out a
patent for the discovery, but I have no wish to
profit by monopoly. All I desire is, that it may
be recollected that the machine was invented by
one who is</p>

<h3>James Black's Device</h3>

<p>In 1858, James Black, Machine Maker, of
Edinburgh, Scotland, applied for a British patent
on</p>

<p>"An improved mode or means of obtaining,
applying, and transmitting motive power."</p>

<p>The expected operation is sufficiently illustrated
by the following figure and excerpt from
the specifications:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A face plate or disc is fixed on an axis, and
has formed in it a number of wipers, eccentrics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
or curved paths, which
receive (in the space
taken out) a pulley or
roller, free to revolve
on its own axis, and attached
to an adjustable
lever in equal balance
with the desired lift or
pressure. On rotary
motion being communicated
to the plate (by a band or otherwise), the
pulley or roller moves round the eccentrics or
paths, imparting a rocking motion to the lever
(similar to the action of a beam), wherefrom
motion may be transmitted or applied, as desired,
or converted by suitable appliances into any description
of motion.</p>

<div id="if_i_102" class="figright" style="width: 165px;"><img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="165" height="141" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>In connection herewith, a pump may be set
in a tank of water, and a tank added above; on
the same shaft with the face plate is a water-wheel
driven by the water from above; when it
passes the centre, the water falls into the lower
tank and is pumped up again; whatever weight
of water is in each stroke is equalized by a balance
weight on the lever; the number of eccentrics
and size of water-wheel may be increased to correspond
with the quantity of water required to
secure a desired power.</p>

<p>One means of imparting rotary motion from
my arrangement is by attaching at the end of the
lever a crank and connecting rod of same radius
as the lift of the lever, carried over the centre by
a fly wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
The invention is applicable to the actuating
of pumps, mincing machines, and other machinery,
instruments, and apparatus, and to parts
thereof; to propelling on land and water, and to
various motive purposes.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is an elevation, showing an arrangement
for obtaining power according to my invention.
X is the general framework of the apparatus;

and formed with curved paths B; the same shaft
E also carries a water-wheel W, provided with
vanes or blades <i>w w</i>, as is usual; C is a roller,
working in the paths B, and connected to a lever
D, attached to rods <i>d d</i> of pumps G G. G¹ is a
balance weight at the further end of the lever,
which is supported in the bearing <i>f</i>; H H are
tanks fixed below the water-wheel, and I is a

the water from tanks H H to the tank I;

the tank I on the wheel W, drives that wheel in
the usual manner; and when it passes the centre,
the water falls into the lower tanks H, from which
it is pumped up again into the upper tank I by the
pumps G, actuated by the levers E, driven by the
rollers C, in the pathways B of the face plate A,
as the latter is caused to revolve by the revolution
of the water-wheel W on the same shaft with it,
thus producing a continuous motive power.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Archimedean Screw and Liquid</h3>

<p>This device was made public by a communication
from a correspondent to "Mechanics'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Magazine" in England, in 1823. The device is
described as follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_104" class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;"><img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="307" height="254" alt="" /><br /></div>

<blockquote>

<p>A is the screw turning on its two pivots G G;
B is a cistern to be filled above the level of the
lower aperture of the screw with mercury (which
I conceive to be preferable to water on many accounts,
and principally because it does not adhere
or evaporate like water); C is a reservoir, which,
when the screw is turned round, receives the
mercury which falls from the top; D is a pipe,
which by the force of gravity conveys the mercury
from the reservoir C on to (what, for want of a
better term, may be called) the float-board E,
fixed at right angles to the centre of the screw,
and furnished at its circumference with ridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
or floats to intercept the mercury, the moment
and weight of which will cause the float-board
and screw to revolve, until, by the proper inclination
of the floats, the mercury falls into the receiver
F, from whence it again falls by its spout
into the cistern G, where the constant revolution
of the screw takes it up again as before.</p>

<p>To overcome this (the power of the fluid in
the screw to turn it backwards), I thought of
placing a metallic ball, or some mercury, on the
ledge above the floats (as at H in the drawing),
of just so much weight, and no more, as would
exactly neutralize this backward endeavor;
whether or no this would increase the difficulty
of raising the mercury in the screw I cannot say,
having never tried the experiment.</p></blockquote>

<h3>John Sims's Problem. 1830</h3>

<p>John Sims, a Welshman, furnished the following
suggested device to "Mechanics' Magazine"
in 1830:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let us suppose an apparatus to be constructed
of the description represented in the annexed
engraving: <i>a</i> is a water cistern, whence
water is to be raised by the pump <i>b</i>, to supply the
cistern; <i>c d</i> is a small pipe with a stop-cock at <i>e</i>,
which lets the water from cistern <i>c</i> into a strong
water-tight bellows <i>f</i>. The bellows have no valve,
but a cock <i>g</i> to let out the water into cistern <i>a</i>; <i>h</i>
is a weight, and <i>i</i> a rack on the top of the bellows
which works in the cogs on the axle of the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
cog-wheel <i>j</i>; <i>j</i> turns the little cog-wheel <i>k</i>, that
gives motion to the arm <i>l</i>, and works the pump-handle
<i>m</i>; <i>n</i> is an upright rod on the end of the
lever <i>o</i>, which rod has a turn at <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> for the
top of the bellows to press against in ascending
and descending. The water being let into the
bellows from the pipe <i>d</i>, will cause the top of the
bellows, with the weight and rack, to ascend till
the former reaches and presses <i>p</i>, which will move
the lever <i>o</i> and the arm or rod <i>r</i>; by which means
the stop-cock <i>e</i> of the pipe will be shut, and the
cock <i>g</i> opened, and the water let in from the bellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
into the cistern <i>a</i>. The top of the bellows
will now descend till it comes down and presses
the turn <i>q</i>, which will again shut the cock <i>g</i> and
open <i>e</i>, on which the water will again flow from
the pipe into the bellows, and cause the top with
the rack to ascend.</p>

<div id="if_i_106" class="figcenter" style="width: 189px;"><img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="189" height="345" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Now it is generally known that the power of
an hydrostatic bellows is thus <span class="locked">calculated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As the area of the orifice or section of the
pipe,</p>

<p>To the area of the bellows:</p>

<p>The weight of water in the pipe is,</p>

<p>To the weight the bellows will sustain on the
top-board.</p>

<p>We will suppose, therefore, the pipe <i>d</i> to be
10 feet high, with a bore equal to 1 square inch,
which would give 120 cubic inches, and about 4¼
lbs. of water. Let us suppose, also, the boards
of the bellows to be 20 inches square, which gives
400 square inches. When the water is let from
the pipe into the bellows, there will be a pressure
of 4¼ lbs. on every square inch, which on the
whole will amount to 1,700 lbs. Now take half of
this force and place it on the top of the bellows;
there will then be a working power of 850 lbs. up
and down, and allowing the bellows to raise one
foot, it will contain about 20 gallons of water.
Now the question is, will not the machinery, with
a moving power of 2 feet and 850 lbs., raise 20
gallons of water 10 feet, which would, of course,
cause the motion to be perpetual?&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Sims.</span></p>

<p>Pwllheli, North Wales, Dec. 11, 1829.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
The foregoing device brought from another
correspondent the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Had Mr. Sims gained the power exerted by
the descending weight on his bellows, he would
have been fortunate indeed; but it unfortunately
happens that its returning power (or an equivalent)
was expended in raising it.</p>

<p>With respect to his question, whether a circulation
of water would be kept up by the arrangement,
I answer, no; as the velocities will be
in the inverse ratios to the forces, and the descending
column of 120 inches must expend itself
forty times to raise the ascending one to the
height of twelve inches, as <span class="locked">proposed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>10 ft. or 120 in. × 40 = 4,800, lifting force
or power.</p>

<p>400 in. × 12 = 4,800, opposing force, resistance,
or weight.</p>

<p>Here is an equilibrium, and nothing gained
to overcome friction or the weight of the atmosphere
on the piston of the pump. Were it possible
to annihilate both friction and atmospheric
weight, even then, unless the power exceed the
weight, the power would not be a moving one.</p></blockquote>

<h3>A Perpetual Pump, by an Unknown Inventor</h3>

<p>In Volume I of "Mechanics' Magazine,"
1823, appears an account by a correspondent of a
Perpetual Motion device which is illustrated by
the figure, and the quotations following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>a b c d</i> is the section of the reservoir, &amp;c.,
showing the wheel, the pump, &amp;c. A B is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
overshot water-wheel; C D the working beam;
E the pump; F a pipe from the top of the pump,
through which the water was to fall upon the
wheel; C G an arm, communicating, by means of
a crank attached to an horizontal shaft through
the centre of the wheel, motion to the lever or
working beam, and so raising water from the
reservoir by means of the pump; H I the water.
It was supposed that the water which had fallen
upon the wheel into the reservoir would be raised
by means of the pump, fall through the horizontal
pipe, and so produce a continued rotary motion.</p></blockquote>

<div id="if_i_109" class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;"><img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="312" height="183" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The persistence of Perpetual Motion workers
is amusingly illustrated by the inventions of
William Willcocks Sleigh and Burrowes Willcocks
Arthur Sleigh. Their devices were so extremely
complicated and not susceptible of being
understood, and hence are mentioned rather than
shown in this work.</p>

<p>In 1845, William Willcocks Sleigh, a doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
of medicine and surgery, of Chiswick, Middlesex,
England, applied for and obtained British Patent
on what he called</p>

<p>"A Hydro-mechanic apparatus for producing
motive power."</p>

<p>He took out other patents on hydro-mechanical
devices in 1853, 1856, and 1860. Then in
1864, his son, Burrowes Willcocks Arthur Sleigh
took out two patents on similar devices, and then
in 1866, still another patent.</p>

<p>The specifications for each of the above mentioned
patents are lengthy and detailed. The inventors
evidently had the greatest confidence in
their efforts, though surely they never put them
to actual test. They seemed to have been mechanically
stupid, and incapable of correct mechanical
thinking, but their efforts were so tireless
and so earnest that we submit that the Sleigh
family had done its full, fair share in the efforts
to accomplish Self-Motive power.</p>

<p>Equally amusing are the efforts of James
Smith of Seaforth, Liverpool, and Sidney Arthur
Chease, Liverpool, gentlemen: These two co-laborers
applied for British patents on four different
Hydro-mechanical devices&mdash;one in 1858,
two in 1863, and one in 1865. On three they
obtained patents, and on the other one provincial
protection. One of them seems to have been a
capitalist, and the other one a machinist. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
models were complicated beyond understanding,
and apparently they were laboring in the dark
without intelligent plan. They seemed to have
thought that when a complicated mess of machinery
parts and fluid were assembled Perpetual
Motion must somehow result.</p>

<p>Nothing could be gained by setting forth
their inventions fully, but their labors were so
great, and their efforts so intense that we feel
like preserving their names from oblivion, and
hence we give them mention here.</p>

<h3>Why Hydraulic and Hydro-Mechanical Devices
for Obtaining Perpetual Motion
Failed to Work</h3>

<p>Next to wheels and weights, the use of
liquids in a hydraulic, hydrostatic, or hydro-mechanical
manner have been sought to be utilized
by Perpetual Motion seekers as a means of obtaining
energy from the machine not supplied to
the machine. The foregoing are only a few of
the many devices of that kind, but they are the
most simple of those that have been brought to
light, and consequently better illustrate the manner
in which it has been sought to utilize the
interesting properties of liquid pressure and mobility
in the solution of the problem.</p>

<p>An examination of the preceding devices
discloses that in each case the inventor sought by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the energy of the descent of a liquid to elevate
through the same distance of ascent the same or
a greater quantity of the same liquid, or in some
cases to obtain from the pressure of a liquid a
greater force than is required to expand a bag,
bellows or vessel, submerged the same distance
below the level.</p>

<p>The impossibility of all of these schemes is
apparent from the same reasoning that is applied
to illustrate and show the impossibility of obtaining
Perpetual Motion by the use of wheels,
weights, levers and the force of gravity.</p>

<p>In each case the basic idea and error was in
supposing that by some possibility the descent of
a liquid through a given distance could be made
to deliver more energy than would be required
to elevate the same quantity of liquid the same
distance. As a matter of fact, the descent of a
liquid, the same as any other weight, through a
given distance represents exactly the amount of
energy necessary to elevate the same weight of
liquid through the same distance measured vertically.
Some loss by friction of the liquid in the
containing tubes is inevitable as well as from
friction in the working parts of the mechanism.
Therefore, as this loss continues, some outside
energy must be supplied. If all friction could be
eliminated (which is an impossibility) and if the
liquid were started in motion, the motion would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
be constant, but no energy could be taken from it
for running other machinery without reducing
the motion.</p>

<p>There have been many arguments on this
subject. We select one which was elicited by the
publication in "Mechanics' Magazine" of an account
of the device of the author of the "Voice
of Reason." This argument was published in
"Mechanics' Magazine" in 1831, and is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am induced to make an attempt to demonstrate
the utter impossibility, under any circumstances,
of making a water-wheel that will supply
itself instead of having any surplus power.</p>

<p>The accompanying drawing represents part
of an overshot wheel in section, the buckets only
part filled, by which the whole of the water expended
continues to act through a greater portion
of the circumference than it otherwise would do.
The area of the vertical section of the complement
of water to each bucket is made 40 inches; and
taking the breadth of the wheel at, say 28 2/3
inches, gives 40 lbs. as the weight of water in
each bucket; therefore, as there are 12 buckets
containing 40 lbs. each, No. 13 30 lbs., and No.
14 only 20 lbs., altogether making a total of 530
lbs. acting on the wheel at the same time;&mdash;to
show clearly all the effect that can be expected
from this, I have divided the horizontal radius
into a scale of 40 equals parts (there being 40 lbs.
in each bucket); and from the gravitating centre
of the fluid contained in each is drawn a perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to the scale, where the effective force,
or weight in each bucket, may be read off as on
the arm of a common steelyard. The weights
will be found as follows, <span class="locked">viz:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="center-table">

<p>It is therefore quite evident that, although
we have 530 lbs. acting on one side of the wheel,
a column of water weighing 446 lbs. reacting at
the same distance from the centre, on the opposite
side, will exactly balance the whole 530 lbs.
contained in the buckets; so that about a sixth of
the expenditure rests on the axis without producing
any useful effect, and the wheel so loaded
must remain in a state of rest. Now, in spite of
friction and the <i>vis inertia</i> of matter, if we suppose
the wheel at work, it can raise only 446 lbs.
at the expense of 530 lbs.; but even if it could raise
the whole 530 lbs., we should then be but little
nearer the mark, for we must remember that the
gravitating centre of our power falls through a
space of only 8 ft. 11 in., while the water must be
raised at least 11 ft. before it could be laid on and
delivered clear of the wheel.</p>

<div id="if_i_115" class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;"><img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="352" height="541" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>As a further means of coming at the end I
had in view at the commencement of this letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
I will conclude with a simple rule for calculating
the quantity of water a wheel of this kind will
raise:&mdash;Multiply the number of pounds expended
in a minute by the height or diameter of the
wheel in feet, divide the product by the height
(also in feet) of the reservoir to be filled, and two-thirds
of the quotient will be the answer required.
Example, for the wheel above described, making
six revolutions per <span class="locked">minute:&mdash;</span></p>

<pre>
        42 buckets on wheel.
         6 revolutions per minute.
       ---
       252 buckets filled per minute.
        40 the weight of water in each bucket.
     -----
     10080 lbs. expended per minute.
        10 feet height of wheel.
    ------
11) 100800 momentum, dividing by 11 feet as
             the height of reservoir.
    ------
   3) 9163.636 divided by 3.
      --------
      3054.545 multiplying by 2.
             2
      --------
      6109.09  answer in lbs.
</pre>

<p class="in0">So that for every 1008 gallons expended on the
wheel, we only gain sufficient power to supply 611
nearly.</p>

<p class="p1 smaller">See also Chap. XV, Bishop Wilkin's Work, appearing at

<h3>The Hydrostatical Paradox</h3>

<p>Next to the wheel with levers and weights,
we believe this simple Hydrostatical Paradox has
more frequently occurred to mechanical and
scientific tyros as a means whereby it was hoped
to attain Perpetual Motion. There is no record
that we know of of the name of anyone who has
ever attempted it, and, yet, the instances are
doubtless myriads.</p>

<p>The author believes he has heard dozens of
young persons mention it as a means of obtaining
a continuous flow of water.</p>

<p>In 1828, Niel Arnott, M. D., published the
third edition of his "Elements of Physics, or Natural
Philosophy." At page 141 under the subject
of "Mechanics" he comments generally on
the subject of Perpetual Motion, and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What an infinity of vain schemes&mdash;some of
them displaying great ingenuity&mdash;for perpetual
motions, and new mechanical engines of power,
etc., would have been checked at once, had the
great truth been generally understood, that no
form or combination of machinery ever did or
ever can increase, in the slightest degree, the
quantity of power applied. Ignorance of this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the hinge on which most of the dreams of mechanical
projectors have turned. No year passes,
even now, in which many patents are not taken
out for such supposed discoveries; and the deluded
individuals, after selling perhaps even their
household goods to obtain the means of securing
the supposed advantages, often sink in despair,
when their attempts, instead of bringing riches
and happiness to their families, end in disappointment
and utter ruin. The frequency and eagerness
and obstinacy with which even talented individuals,
owing to their imperfect knowledge of
this part of natural philosophy, have engaged in
such undertakings, is a remarkable phenomenon
in human nature.</p></blockquote>

<p>At page 270 in treating on "Hydrostatics,"
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<div id="if_i_118" class="figleft" style="width: 96px;"><img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="96" height="94" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A projector thought that the vessel of his
contrivance, represented here, was to solve the renowned
problem of the perpetual motion. It was
goblet-shaped, lessening gradually
towards the bottom until it
became a tube, bent upwards at
<i>c</i>, and pointing with an open extremity
into the goblet again.
He reasoned thus: A pint of
water in the goblet <i>a</i> must more
than counterbalance an ounce
which the tube <i>b</i> will contain, and must therefore
be constantly pushing the ounce forward into the
vessel again at <i>a</i>, and keeping up a stream or circulation,
which will cease only when the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
dries up. He was confounded when a trial
showed him the same level in <i>a</i> and in <i>b</i>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Pickering's Device</h3>

<p>In 1858, Peter Pickering, Landed Proprietor
of Danzig, Prussia, applied for a British patent
on</p>

<p>"An Atmospheric Engine."</p>

<p>It may be described as follows:</p>

<h3>Stuckey's Device</h3>

<p>In 1842, William Henry Stuckey, Esquire,
of St. Petersburgh, applied for a British patent
on</p>

<p>"A Pneumatic Engine for Producing Motive
Power."</p>

<p>His specifications describe his alleged invention
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fig. 1 is a front view of my said pneumatic
engine, partly in section. A¹ and B¹ two horizontal
cylinders, united at their inner extremities
a, a, which rotate on gudgeons that have their
bearings C, C, in the upright standards D, D; A²
and B² two pistons which work to and fro in these
cylinders; E¹ and E³ two hollow arms or tubes
which radiate from the cylinder A¹, and E², E⁴,
two similar arms or tubes which radiate in opposite
directions from the cylinder B¹, each cylinder
having an open communication with the arms or
tubes attached to it. F¹, F², F³, and F⁴, four other
cylinders, affixed to a circular ring R, R, open at
top to the atmosphere, and open at bottom to the

a wheel, which, on being set in motion, rotates on
the gudgeons in the bearing C, C. The motion is
produced as follows:&mdash;I adjust the wheel so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the tubes E¹ and E³ shall be in a vertical position;
and pour into the tube E¹, through the cylinder
F¹, withdrawing the piston G¹, as much mercury
or other suitable fluid body (previously determined
by calculation) as will fill the tube from
the point of its connection with the inner cylinder
A¹ up to the bottom (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,) of the outer cylinder
F¹. The mercury thus introduced flows into the
cylinder A¹ at the back of the piston A², and
presses that piston forward
to the extremity
of its range, the piston
G¹ being then restored
to its place in the cylinder
F¹, and pressed
close down on the
mercury in the tube
E¹. I next turn the
wheel till the tubes E²
and E⁴ are in a vertical
position, by which turning the mercury therein is
forced into the tube E³, flowing down which it
drives the piston G³ of the cylinder F³ forward to
the extremity of its range, leaving a vacuum in
the cylinder A¹ at O, equal to the difference between
the heights from which the mercury descends
in the tubes E¹ and E³. I then fill the tube
E² and cylinder B² with mercury, to the same extent
and in the same way as I previously filled the
tube E¹ and cylinder A¹, after which I turn the
wheel till the tubes E¹ and E³ are once more in a
vertical position, whereby I produce a vacuum
in each pair of tubes, and their intermediate cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to the degree of the difference before explained.
To the four tubes there are attached four
cocks K¹, K², K³, K⁴, which, after the vacua have
been obtained, are closed; and to the four rods of
the pistons of the outer cylinders F¹, F², F³, F⁴,
there are attached four hanging or balance
weights L¹, L², L³, L⁴, in such manner that they
shall co-operate with the atmospheric pressure on
the said vacua in giving rotation to the wheel.
M¹, M², M³, M⁴, are jointed levers, by which these
weights are connected at one end with the pistons
G¹, G², G³, G⁴; and N¹, N², are cords or bands, by
which they are suspended at the other end from
standards P, P, projecting from the ring R, and
bearing pulleys, over which the cords or bands
pass, each cord or band serving to suspend the two
weights which are opposite to each other, for
which purpose it is passed internally across the
wheel and over the exterior of one of the cylinders
A¹ or B¹. The cords or bands are attached to
the weights at the lower ends thereof, and pass
over small pulleys close to the points of connection,
so that the cords or bands, when pulled, may
act the more effectually on the weights. It will
be readily understood that when any two of the
tubes are in a vertical position, and the mercury
or other suitable fluid has descended to the bottom
of the lower tube, its pressure on the piston
of the outer cylinder G¹, or G², or G³, or G⁴, will
cause the weight connected with that piston to
turn inwards towards the centre of the wheel, by
which movement a strain is exerted on the connecting
cord or band N¹ or N², which throws up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the opposite weight at top, and causes it to force
down the piston of the top cylinder, or the surface
of the mercury in the upper tube, whereby any
excess of pressure at the bottom of the lower tube
is transferred to the top piston, where it acts in
aid of the atmospheric pressure on the vacua obtained
in manner aforesaid. The four cocks K,
have regulating rods connected to them in the way
common in steam and other engines, so that as
each tube comes into a vertical position the cock
attached to it is opened, and as it passes from that
position towards the horizontal, is shut, so that
the mercury always retains its proper position in
the tubes or cylinders, and is acted on by the pressure
of the atmosphere at those points only where
such pressure can be of service. The power of
this wheel will be, of course, in proportion to the
vacua produced in manner aforesaid, and to the
altitude of the columns of mercury employed.
The inner cylinders might be dispensed with, and
the tubes be made to communicate directly with
each other, but I prefer, for most purposes, the
arrangement which I have before described, with
the two intermediate cylinders A¹, B¹; where the
inner cylinders are dispensed with, I make use of
eccentrics instead of the joined levers before described,
to enable the weights to turn to the extent
of about half a circle. The number of tubes also
need not be limited to four, but increased to any
convenient extent.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Prof. George Sinclair's Device</h3>

<p>This device was invented by George Sinclair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
who was a professor of philosophy at Glasgow
University. He died in 1696. In 1669 he published
a work on Pneumatics, and in that work
claimed to have discovered Perpetual Motion.
Explanations of his device consumed eighteen
pages of a Latin work on Pneumatics. It very
absurdly depended for its operation upon the delivery
of water from the short leg of a siphon,
instead of the long leg. The figure illustrates
the contemplated operation.</p>

<h3>Läserson's Device</h3>

<p>In 1860 Marc Antoine F. Mennons, of Paris,
applied on behalf of Louis Diodor Läserson of
Moscow, Russia, for, and obtained, a British
patent on</p>

<p>"Certain Improvements in the Production
of Motive Power, and in the Apparatus Connected
Therewith."</p>

<p>He described the essentials of his device as
follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_127" class="figcenter" style="width: 329px;"><img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="329" height="200" alt="" /><br /></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The invention consists in the application of
the ascensional force of air or gases developed
under water to the generation of motive power,
and in the combination of apparatus, by means of
which the power thus produced is accumulated,
transmitted and applied. The principal element
of this combination is a wheel or disc (shown in
plan and section, Figs. 1, 2), the dimensions of
which are proportioned to the power required.
On the circumference of this wheel are fixed at
equal distances a given number (say sixteen) of
flexible air reservoirs <i>a</i>, communicating with an
equal number of tubular passages <i>b</i>, which open
in the nave <i>c</i>. In the length of the fixed shaft
<i>d</i>, on which this wheel is mounted, are formed
two cylindrical cells E by which the air is admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
to and discharged from the flexible reservoirs
<i>a</i> by the tubular passages <i>b</i>, with which
they correspond. The hydro-atmospheric wheel
thus mounted and immersed to the required depth
in a suitable reservoir as in <i>f</i>, is placed in communication
by its hollow shaft with an air-compressing
apparatus of any convenient form, which
in its turn is connected with the shaft of an ordinary
hydraulic wheel. The latter being set in
motion acts on the forcing apparatus, by which a
jet of compressed air is thrown into the hollow
shaft of the hydro-atmospheric wheel by the entry
cell corresponding with the orifices of the fourth
quadrant or lowest immersed section of the latter.
The air injected following the tubular passages
within its range enters and inflates the corresponding
flexible reservoirs, which thus acquiring
an ascensional force proportioned to their
displacing capacity and degree of immersion,
carry forward the wheel in their movement towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the surface. On reaching the water line
the tubular passage come into communication by
the nave orifices with the discharge cell of the
fixed shaft, and give egress to the air compressed
in the flexible reservoirs, which collapse simultaneously
with the inflation of the succeeding
series by which they have in the meantime been
replaced in the fourth quadrant. The latter following
the ascensional movement of their predecessors
give place to a third series, and collapse
in the same way on passing the surface, so that
each air reservoir on re-entering the water in the
continued revolution of the wheel presents comparatively
little resistance until it arrives at the
turning point, when the communication with the
entry cell of the axle being again established the
movements above described are reproduced. The
force thus developed by the hydro-atmospheric
wheel, which represents about three times that
of the prime motor, may be at this stage applied
to the required transmissions of movement.
When natural watercourses are not to be had
within a reasonable distance of the locality in
which the force is to be applied, it becomes necessary
to replace them by an artificial fall.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Von Rathen and Ellis's Device</h3>

<p>In 1866 Anthony Bernhard Baron Von
Rathen and George Henry Ellis, both of London,
applied for and obtained British patent on</p>

<p>"A New or Improved Mode of Constructing
a Motive-power Wheel Whereby to Obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Permanent Motion by the Application of Compressed
Air or any other Elastic Fluid."</p>

<p>In the specifications for patent the essentials
of their invention are described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This invention may be considered supplementary
to an invention of the Baron Von Rathen
of an elementary motive-power engine, for which
a patent has been granted to him, No. 818, and
dated March 23, 1865, and consisting in a newly-discovered
plan for the construction of a motive-power
wheel or engine, on the principle that the
motor, consisting of compressed air or other elastic
fluid, is maintained in permanent activity and
without removal or renewal, and the useful resistance
of the air in the chambers is on the surface
of a fixed cylinder, the motion is regular and
direct, the wheel rotating on its fixed central axis.</p>

<p>The nature of our present invention consists
principally in our providing, instead of that a
motive-power wheel having its axis upon fixed
bearings in an eccentric position and turning in
an oscillating cylinder. The motor being brought
through a hollow shaft, or any convenient channel,
is introduced into one or more closed chambers
formed upon the longest arm of the power
wheel for the purpose of driving it round; by this
means, according to the uniform pressure of the
elastic fluid upon all surfaces, we obtain not only
a continuous but an additional degree of driving
power from the leverage given by the position of
the wheel. There is, as shown in Fig. 1 of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
accompanying drawing, a fixed arm or driving
rod fixed upon the cylinder by which to impart
motion to a crank, piston, or other apparatus.
We propose to obtain the motor by pumps worked
by or in connection with the power wheel, and
having other suitable and necessary appliances
for regulating, storing, transmitting, and manipulating
the force supplied to or communicated
by the power wheel, as have been described, to be
applied with the plan for working the elementary
motive-power engine hereinbefore referred to.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is a vertical section of the power wheel
revolving inside and moving the oscillating cylinder.</p>

<p>A¹ and A² are air-tight chambers, the former
being the driving chamber and the latter intended
to check or counterbalance its wedging or binding
effect upon the cylinder, owing to the extra leverage
obtained and the pressure upon the surface
of the rod B, the wheel will revolve in that direction
by the action of the elastic force which finds
its useful resistance on the internal surface of the
cylinder C. D¹, D², D³, D⁴, are packings to render
the two chambers air-tight and to afford bearings
for the four arms of the wheel upon the
cylinder; E, E, are two tubes for conducting the
motor into the chambers, and F is the axle, upon
which the wheel is firmly fixed and driven round
with it.</p>

F is the hollow shaft or axle through which the
motor passes from the pumps or reservoir in connection
therewith, and upon which the wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
rotates; G is the rod or arm fixed at one end to
the cylinder C, and attached at the other end by a

<h3>Richard Varley's Device</h3>

<p>In 1797 Richard Varley, of Damside, Lancashire,
England, a merchant, applied for and obtained
a British patent on</p>

<p>"A New Perpetual Moving Power."</p>

<p>His device is explained by the following
excerpt from his application:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My invention consists of a method of applying
the weight of the atmosphere upon a wheel in
any other fluid, and by that means destroying its
spring or reaction, the manner of doing which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
describe as follows, agreeable to the drawing
(Fig. 6) annexed:</p>

<div id="if_i_132" class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;"><img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="394" height="425" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>"A is a circular vessel, made of copper or any
other substance, capable of containing water, and
covered with a top part so as to be perfectly air-tight.
B is a wheel placed in the inside of the
vessel, with its axle perpendicular, the uppermost
part of which comes through the top of the vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and is made to work air-tight; the lower end runs
in a step within the vessel, and no part of the
wheel is to touch the vessel but its axis. C is a cylinder
placed firmly upon the wheel. D is the piston,
suspended by a chain to a strong spring fixed
on the wheel. This spring is to be made of such
strength as that when the whole weight of the
atmosphere is upon the piston the air will only
move it about one inch down. E is the tube leading
from the axle, which is hollow from the top to
the level of the wheel, so as to admit the external
air by this tube to the piston D, which piston is a
circular vessel, made air-tight, and exactly fits
the cylinder. There is a joint in the tube E at F,
which is made air-tight by leathers, so that when
the piston descends the tube may give way to it.
G is a small tube leading from the bottom of the
cylinder to the center of the axle, and from thence
brought out at the end of it, and by which the air
is extracted from the cylinder by means of an air
pump and a vacuum formed in it. On the top
part or any other convenient place of the vessel,
are fixed two cylinders or tubes of a proportional
size to the cylinders on the wheel, one of which
is a condensing cylinder, by means of a screw and
piston, and by which the water in the vessel may
be compressed; the other has its piston suspended
at the bottom, and the top part of the cylinder
being filled with air as the other piston is screwed
down this rises, and condenses the air in the cylinder,
the spring of which keeps the water in the
vessel pressed to all parts alike; and when the air
is extracted from the cylinder C and the piston D<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
is forced down by the external atmosphere into
the cylinder, this pressure is continued, and the
condensed air expands in proportion and prevents
any tendency to a vacuum being formed, which
would cause a cohesion of all the parts. By this
means the external air is suspended upon the
wheel by the chain, the same as a weight, and the
spring of the atmosphere being taken from the
cylinder there is nothing to oppose this weight,
there being no spring in water; and this power
may be increased in proportion to the size and
number of cylinders on the wheel and its diameter."</p></blockquote>

<h3>Siphon and Funnel Device</h3>

<p>This was the work of an Englishman whose
name is unknown. An account of it appeared in
"Mechanics' Magazine," 1828, in the following
language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>a</i> is a circular glass vessel 1 foot 6 inches
diameter; <i>b b</i> a tube fixed thereunto; <i>c c</i> are funnels
containing valves; <i>d</i>, a float of hollow copper,
or any light substance; <i>e</i>, an open mouth; <i>f</i>,
an open vessel filled with mercury as high as the
dotted line.</p>

<p>It is well known that several experiments
were made by M. Venturi, Sir Isaac Newton, etc.,
demonstrating that a vessel shaped <span class="locked">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<div id="if_i_134" class="figcenter" style="width: 58px;"><img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="58" height="93" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">will emit water with a much greater rapidity than
a vessel shaped <span class="locked">thus&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">say, with more than a third as much speed. I
propose, then, to have the mouth of the vessel <i>a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
of the former shape, being the natural form of
flowing water. The vessel <i>a</i>, and tube <i>b</i>, must
be completely filled with mercury, by means of the
funnels <i>c c</i>, which will also contain mercury. In
order to set the fluid in motion, the valve in the
large vessel <i>c</i> is to be raised; the mercury (which
was hitherto held up by a greater weight of atmosphere)
will instantly run out of the mouth <i>e</i>,
and must be suffered to do so till the mercury in
<i>c</i> is level with the dotted line; by this time the
mercury in <i>a</i> will have obtained a momentum
which will be more than equivalent to the pressure
of the atmosphere: consequently, the mercury
will run out of the large vessel <i>a</i>, till it falls as
low as the dotted line; the float <i>d</i>, resting on the
mercury, of course, falls with it, opens the valve,
and admits a proportionable quantity of mercury
through the tube <i>b</i>, driven by the pressure of the
atmosphere (the height from the mercury in <i>f</i>,
to the top of the tube <i>b</i>, being only 26 inches,
which is 2 inches less than what the atmosphere
will at all times raise mercury in a vacuum).</p>

<p>By this means will there not be a continual
circulation of mercury?</p></blockquote>

<h3>Orchard's Vacuum Engine</h3>

<p>In 1826 there was published in "Mechanics'
Magazine," London, a communication from a Mr.
Orchard, concerning an invention he considered
himself as having made. The account is published
in his own words, and is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>A is an iron reservoir nearly filled with mercury;
B, a tube twenty-four inches long, having
its lower end inserted in that reservoir; and C and
D, two cocks for the convenience of filling the
tube B. From this another tube M proceeds at
right angles, to the vessel G. In this latter tube
is the cock F, to admit of, or shut off, a communication
between the tube and the vessel G. This
communication being closed, the tube B is carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
filled with mercury; after which the cock D
is closed and the cap E screwed on.</p>

<div id="if_i_137" class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;"><img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="365" height="388" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The vessel G is to be filled with mercury
through the cock H, the pipe I being open to allow
of the escape of air. When this vessel has been
filled, the cock H should be closed and its cap
screwed on; and the pipe I be also closed by a
valve, which is to be pressed tight by the cap on
the head of the pipe. I is a vent-pipe, open at the
top. The space represented by the double lines
is a panel of thick plate glass having two horizontal
lines described on its surface, whereby the
attendant may observe the quantity of mercury
within the vessel.</p>

<p>The cock F being closed, a quantity of mercury
must be allowed to run out of the vessel G,
equal to the space 1, 2, 3, 4, which space will become
a vacuum. If, therefore, the cock L be
then opened, to allow of the discharge of a certain
quantity of mercury on the wheel, and the
cocks C and L also opened, the mercury will continually
rise from the reservoir A into the vessel
G, and thence be discharged on the wheel, whence
it will again fall into the vessel A, to keep up the
supply. The cock F must be so adjusted as to
admit into the vessel G a quantity of mercury
equal to that which is discharged by the cock L.
This can be ascertained and regulated by means
of the panel of glass above described.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of mercury being 7½
ounces, it is evident that but a small quantity of
it is required to turn the wheel, which has no
friction but that of the axis on which it turns.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Robert Copland's Device</h3>

<p>In 1819 Robert Copland applied for a British
patent on</p>

<p>"A New or Improved Method or Methods of
Gaining Power by New or Improved Combinations
of Apparatus, Applicable to Various Purposes."</p>

<p>His specifications describe in great detail his
invention in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>

<div id="if_i_139" class="figleft" style="width: 152px;"><img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="152" height="184" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Figure 1 is a view of a machine by which I
purpose to derive a disposable force or power
from the action, weight or pressure of the atmosphere,
through the medium
of the column of water or
other heavy liquid descending
on one side of the enclosed
vertical wheel, and
from thence through the
centrifugal wheel, being returned
into the same reservoir
from which the pressure
of the atmosphere
raises it to be again delivered
on the top of the
vertical wheel to supply the discharge on the descending
side, arising from the centrifugal force
communicated to it by the rotary velocity of the
centrifugal wheel, and the pressure of the descending
column overbalancing the reaction or
resistance of the atmosphere at the discharging
apertures of the centrifugal wheel. Thus a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
quantity of water or other liquid (according to
the size of the machine required) being continually
returned onto the top of the vertical wheel
by the pressure or action of the atmosphere, and
acting by its unbalanced gravity or impetus in its
descent, will produce a disposable force or power
of any required magnitude, by increasing the size
or number of the machines, provided the height
the fluid is required to be raised is not quite so
high as the column which the atmosphere, when
lightest, will raise of that fluid, and allowing for
the requisite velocity on the vertical wheel. In
Fig. 1, A is the feeding pipe through which the
fluid is raised by the pressure or action of
the atmosphere on the fluid in the lowest
reservoir in which the lower end of the
pipe is immersed, closed by a cock, sliding
plate, valve or shutter, to allow the machine
to be filled at the commencement, and which
may be under the surface of the fluid, also
to keep it air-tight. The other end is inserted
air-tight into the top reservoir, or by a curve, as
shown by the dotted line <i>a</i>, joined to pipe C, and
delivering upon the vertical wheel, without any
top reservoir. In this case, if water is used, the
highest part of the bend or curve inside should
not exceed thirty feet above the level of the water
in lowest reservoir. B is the top reservoir, the
lowest internal part of which should never exceed
twenty-nine or thirty feet above the water in
lowest reservoir, but it will admit the top of the
reservoir, if wished, to be rather higher than
when the curved tube <i>a</i> only is used. It must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
quite air-tight, and supported as convenient. C
is a pipe, joined air-tight to top reservoir, or forming
part of A, <i>a</i>, C. C is a movable flap of
strong leather, or other substance, which may be
joined to the lowest part of C, where the water is
delivered so high on the wheel and where floats
with hinges are used on the wheel to prevent its
going down on the ascending side; but not necessary
when water is delivered lower on the wheel.
D, D, D, D, is the fixed and immovable waterway,
and the fixed case or cover (of the vertical
wheel), of which it is a part, joining also the
stuffing boxes, through which the axle of the
vertical wheel moves air-tight, thus entirely enclosing
and surrounding every part of the wheel
but the projections of the axle, and allowing the
float boards and wheel just to turn freely in it
without touching in any part except the axle in
turning in the packing of the stuffing boxes; the
float boards are fastened on to the iron rim or
sole of the vertical wheel by very strong hinges or
movable joints just within the fixed waterway D.
E is a pipe or pipes joined air-tight to the fixed
cover or case enclosing the vertical wheel where
the water is to be taken off it, having their lower
ends inserted air-tight also into the bottom of the
fixed and immovable top of the centrifugal wheel
in such a direction that they may deliver the water
into the moveable waterway of the centrifugal
wheel as near as possible in the same direction as
the water circulates in the wheel. F, F, is the
centrifugal wheel, of any diameter convenient,
according to the size of the machine, placed horizontally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
above the fluid in the lowest reservoir,
so as to move on its axis as near as possible to
the surface of the fluid without touching it, having
an immovable cover or top, leaving a hollow
waterway round the rim, into which the fluid is
discharged from E in the direction of the wheels'
motion. G, G, are the discharging apertures of
the centrifugal wheel. H, H, is the surface of
the fluid in I, I, the lowest reservoir, containing a
sufficient quantity of water when the machine is
put to work, to allow the bottom of feeding pipe
A to be immersed in it at least two feet below the
surface, or a greater depth may be given to that
part of the reservoir under the mouth of pipe A,
forming a sort of well in which A may be inserted
any required depth, better to exclude any
particles of air or bubbles mixed with the water
nearer its surface from ascending in pipe A. This
reservoir should be large enough to contain the
whole of the water used before the machine is
filled. K, K, are the ends of the axle of vertical
wheel outside of the stuffing boxes of the fixed
case, and are the only parts of the vertical wheel
seen, and turning air-tight through the packing
or stuffing boxes, or in any other manner the external
air is entirely excluded from the vertical
wheel when at work; <i>e</i> is an air-tight cock to
discharge the air out of the machine when filling.
L is an aperture into top reservoir, or into highest
part of pipe A, <i>a</i> when no top reservoir, closed
air-tight by a screw cap; by this the whole machine
is filled in every part with the fluid used
before it can be set to work, the bottom of pipe A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and apertures G (as well as cock to bottom of pipe
E when required) being previously closed. P is
part of the axle on which the centrifugal wheel
revolves. Before the machine can be put to work
everything being previously arranged as directed,
the apertures at G and bottom of A (and at E if
required also), must be closed by sliding plates,
valves, cocks, or other methods, as most convenient,
and every part of the machine must be
filled with the water or fluid used by the aperture
L, or any other convenient method by which the
highest parts may be filled, the air allowed to discharge
by opening E and O, the latter to be shut
as soon as the centrifugal wheel is filled, and the
cock at E closed where required, when the water
is above it a little, <i>e</i> continuing open so as to allow
the air to be entirely discharged from every part,
which being done, and the machine entirely filled
with water, this cock and aperture L must be
carefully closed; having then fixed upon the most
convenient method for giving the required assistance
to set the machine to work, by giving the
centrifugal wheel motion, and assisting it till arrived
at the velocity fixed, it must be put in motion
and the apertures G opened; after it has got a
little into motion, and as soon as the velocity of
the wheel has given a centrifugal force to the
water sufficient to overbalance the slight difference
in the height of the feeding and descending
columns, the pipe A must be opened; a discharge
from the apertures G will now take place, which
is supplied from top reservoir B over the loaded
side of vertical wheel, where, by its gravity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
impetus acting on the float boards, it causes the
wheel to turn till it descends, so as to be discharged
through E, on the rim or waterway W,
of the centrifugal wheel, which it strikes with the
velocity of its descent in nearly the direction of
the wheel's motion, and is discharged through
apertures G into the water contained at commencement
in lower reservoir I, from whence this
discharge is again supplied by the pressure of the
atmosphere, returning it through pipe A into top
reservoir, or through <i>a</i>, C, and the part intended
of the vertical wheel. As the velocity of the
centrifugal wheel is accelerated, the velocity of
the descending column over the vertical wheel
will also be accelerated, and, consequently, the
vertical wheels, when having arrived at their respective
fixed velocities, the assisting force being
no longer necessary, may be withdrawn, and the
centrifugal wheel may now receive what assistance
is required to support its velocity from the
vertical wheel through the connecting shafts and
wheelwork, or in any other manner.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Waterblowing Machine</h3>

<p>In 1827 "Mechanics' Magazine," London,
published an account of an invention which was
furnished to it by some correspondent. The invention,
it seems from the communication, had
previously been described in an appendix by Dr.
Brewster to a volume of Ferguson's lectures, and
it also seems that the description furnished "Mechanics'
Magazine" was copied from such appendix.
The following is the article as it appeared
in "Mechanics' Magazine":</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am encouraged to send you the following
attempt at perpetual motion, because I think it is
upon a principle that has not yet been examined in
your pages.</p>

<p>In Dr. Brewster's appendix to Ferguson's
lectures, the following description is given of
what is called a "Water Blowing Machine": "Let
A B (see Fig.) be a cistern of water, with the
bottom of which is connected the bended leaden
pipe B C H. The lower extremity H, of the pipe
is inserted into the top of a cask or vessel, D E,
called the condensing vessel, having the pedestal
P fitted to its bottom, which is perforated with
two openings, M N. When the water which
comes from the cistern A is falling through the
part, C H of the pipe, it is supplied by the openings
or tubes, <i>m</i> <i>n</i> <i>o</i> <i>p</i>, with a quantity of air
which it carries along with it. This mixture of
air and water, issuing from the aperture H, and
impinging upon the surface of the stone pedestal
P, is driven back and dispersed in various directions.
The air being thus separated from the
water, ascends into the upper part of the vessel,
and rushes through the opening F, whence it is
conveyed to the fire, while the water falls to the
lower part of the vessel, and runs out by the
openings M N." The author then goes on to
describe the construction of the pipe B C H, in
the curve of which some nicety is required, and
to explain some atmospherical phenomena upon
the principle of this machine, adding that "Franciscus
Tertius de Lanis observes that he has seen
a greater wind generated by a blowing machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of this kind than could be produced by bellows
ten or twelve feet long."</p>

<div id="if_i_148" class="figcenter" style="width: 197px;"><img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="197" height="265" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Now, if, instead of the pedestal P, a wheel
were placed in the condensing vessel, as in the
figure, would not the water, in falling upon the
wheel, be sufficiently dispersed to disengage the
air at the same time that it drove the wheel, and
would not the motion of the wheel be retarded by
the density of the internal air?</p>

<p>I do not apprehend that any considerable
resistance would be offered by the internal air,
and the motion of the wheel can be regulated by
its load, so as to offer a sufficient resistance to
the descending stream of water; and I, therefore,
assume that the water, in its descent, would produce
by means of the wheel, a power capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
raising a part of the water expended back again
to the cistern; and this is the extent of the power
of most of those machines which have been mistaken
for perpetual motions by their projectors.
But I have a blast of wind which is described as
being of great force. Can this blast be in any
way applied to raise the surplus water? I think
I see the smile which the proposal will produce in
those who deny the possibility of a perpetual motion.
"A mere puff of wind!" is doubtless ejaculated
from all sides. But let me tell these gentlemen
that, though I may not know any method
by which such blast can produce that effect, it
does not, by any means, follow that the impossibility
of the thing is thence to be presumed. Far
from it; for such a conclusion rests upon the supposition
that the powers and application of a blast
of wind are fully known, and that no research or
experience can add to our knowledge on that subject&mdash;assumptions
which appear to me somewhat
ridiculous. Allow me, for the sake of argument,
to suppose that this blast instead of wind, had
been a blast of steam. Time was when wise men
would have smiled and said, "A puff of steam&mdash;a
mere puff of steam!"&mdash;and had some one, more
sanguine than the rest, attempted by its application
to produce a motion, he would have applied
it to the floatboards of a wheel, as in Branca's
engine, and have been disappointed. It is not
given to man to know when the powers of any
great agent have been fully developed; and those
who act upon such presumptions throw the greatest
obstacles in the way of inquiry. But, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
show the anti-perpetualists that within their own
time since the commencement of the "Mechanics'
Magazine," an addition has been made to our
knowledge of the powers of a blast of wind, I
have added a tube, G, to my figure, the proposed
use of which I shall now describe.</p>

<p>In a part of the "Mechanics' Magazine,"
published some time ago, there was described a
novel mode of raising water in a tube by directing
a stream of air over its mouth, thereby destroying
the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I do not suppose it will rise to the height of
the cistern as I have figured it; but it may still be
a question whether it may not be accomplished
by a series of short tubes, the bottom of the one
being placed in the cistern into which the next
below discharges its water, each being constructed
with a blast and two valves, in the same
manner as the single tube&mdash;namely, the valves <i>x</i>
(under water) and <i>y</i>, worked in such a manner
by the arms K L, that the one may shut when the
other opens. Presuming that the water will rise
to the top of the tube when the blast is in action
(<i>x</i> open and <i>y</i> shut), the water in the part of the
tube between the blast and <i>y</i> will be discharged
into the cistern at the next motion of the valves&mdash;namely,
when <i>x</i> is shut and <i>y</i> opened, the blast, at
the same time, being discontinued.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Device by Means of Buoyancy Through Media
of Different Densities</h3>

<p>An account of this appeared in "Mechanics'
Magazine," 1825. The author apparently had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
no great faith in the accomplishment of Perpetual
Motion, and yet it is manifest that he had not
abandoned hope of accomplishing it, and is still
thinking along some line of attaining it. It goes
without saying that the device failed. The account
furnished, however, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The unsuccessful (but far from fruitless)
search made to discover the "philosopher's stone,"
and the "elixir vitæ," were productive of most
important and beneficial results in the kingdom
of chemistry; so, by a parity of consequence, I
am disposed to believe that from inquiry after
the "perpetual motion" (though equally unsuccessful),
a similar good will result to the mechanical
world. * * I beg leave to offer the prefixed
device. The point at which, like all the
rest, it fails, I confess I did not (as I do now)
plainly perceive at once, although it is certainly
very obvious. The original idea was this&mdash;to
enable a body which would float in a heavy medium
and sink in a lighter one, to pass successively
through the one to the other, the continuation of
which would be the end in view. To say that
valves cannot be made to act as proposed will not
be to show the <i>rationale</i> (if I may so say) upon
which the idea is fallacious.</p>

<p>The figure is supposed to be tubular, and
made of glass, for the purpose of seeing the action
of the balls inside, which float or fall as they
travel from air through water and from water
through air. The foot is supposed to be placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
water, but it would answer the same purpose if
the bottom were closed.</p>

<div id="if_i_152" class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;"><img src="images/i_152.jpg" width="165" height="336" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Description of the Engraving.</span>&mdash;No. 1,
the left leg, filled with water from B to A. 2 and
3, valves, having in their centers very small projecting
valves; they all open upwards. 4, the
right leg, containing air from A to F. 5 and 6,
valves, having very small ones in their centers;
they all open downwards. The whole apparatus
supposed to be air- and water-tight. The round
figures represent hollow balls, which will sink
one-fourth of their bulk in water (of course will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
fall in air); the weight, therefore, of three balls
resting upon one ball in water, as at E, will just
bring this top even with the water's edge; the
weight of four balls will sink it under the surface
until the ball immediately over it is one-fourth its
bulk in water, when the under ball will escape
round the corner at C, and begin to ascend.</p>

<p>The machine is supposed (in the figure) to
be in action, and No. 8 (one of the balls) to have
just escaped round the corner at C, and to be, by
its buoyancy, rising up to valve No. 3, striking
first the small projecting valve in the center,
which, when opened, the large one will be raised
by the buoyancy of the ball; because the moment
the small valve in the center is opened (although
only the size of a pin's head), No. 2 valve will
have taken upon itself to sustain the whole column
of water from A to B. The said ball (No. 8)
having passed through the valve No. 3, will, by
appropriate weights or springs, close; the ball will
proceed upwards to the next valve (No. 2), and
perform the same operation there. Having arrived
at A, it will float upon the surface three-fourths
of its bulk out of water. Upon another
ball in due course arriving under it, it will be
lifted quite out of the water and fall over the
point D, pass into the right leg (containing air),
and fall to valve No. 5, strike and open the small
valve in its center, then open the large one and
pass through; this valve will then, by appropriate
weights or springs, close, the ball will roll on
through the bent tube (which is made in that
form to gain time as well as to exhibit motion)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
to the next valve (No. 6), where it will perform
the same operation, and then, falling upon the
four balls at E, force the bottom one round the
corner at C. This ball will proceed as did No. 8,
and the rest in the same manner successively.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Device by Compressible and Distensible Bags
in Liquid</h3>

<p>In the year 1823, an account of a Perpetual
Motion device was sent to "Mechanics' Magazine"
by some correspondent. This appears to
have considerable claim to ingenuity, though the
correspondent states that "it failed from friction."
The figure and account furnished are as
follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_155" class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;"><img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="318" height="309" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A A A A is a cistern of water, filled as high
as B B. C C C C C C are six bladders, communicating
by the tubes D D D D D D with the hollow
axle E, which axle is connected with the bellows
F by the pipe G. H is a crank connected with
the crank I by the rod K. L is a saucer-wheel,
M a pinion, N its shaft. O is a crank attached
to the bellows F by the rod P. Q Q Q Q Q Q are
valves with a projecting lever. R and S are two
projecting knobs. T is a hole in the axle E, forming
a communication with it and the lowermost
bladder. The axle B being put in motion carried
round the bladders and tables, and by the cranks
H and I, and the connecting-rod K, caused the
wheel L to revolve, which communicating a similar
but accelerated motion to the pinion M, shaft
N, and crank O, worked or blew the bellows F<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
by the rod P; the air entered the axle E by the
tube G, and passing through the hole in it at T,
entered the lower bladder C by the tube D; this
bladder being thus rendered lighter than the space
it occupied, ascended, bringing the bladder behind
it over the hole in the axle T in like manner, and
which thereby gained an ascending power, producing
a similar effect on the one behind it. When
one of the bladders arrived at the knob S, the
lever of the valve Q struck against it and opened
the valve; when the bladder arrived at U and
began to descend, its pressure on the water drove
out the air and gave it a descending power; the
knob R then closed the valve Q and prevented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
entrance of any water into the bladder; by this
contrivance three of the bladders were full and
empty, according as they passed over the hole T
or the knob S.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Why the Devices Described in this Chapter
Failed to Work</h3>

<p>The devices explained in the preceding chapter
are of such complicated and ridiculous structure
that it is impossible to explain anything from
them. It is better to abandon them all and to discuss
in a general way why Perpetual Motion has
not been, and cannot be, attained by devices constructed
on similar plans. An examination of
the preceding devices in this chapter shows that
they depended ultimately upon the fact:</p>

<p>1. That air or some other gas is to be compressed
by work done upon it and that upon expanding
it will do a greater amount of work than
was required for the compression, or</p>

<p>2. That a bag empty, or partially filled with
air, or other gas, can be easily immersed, and that
if blown full of gas while immersed it will, in its
tendency to float, do more work than was required
to immerse it, or</p>

<p>3. That the weight of the atmosphere and
its consequent pressure upon vacua can be utilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to drive a piston, or compress a bag and by
some sort of means at the same time produce
another vacua ready for a similar operation, the
loss of the driven piston, or the compressed bag
being utilized to drive machinery, if desired.</p>

<p>It is now believed by all scientific men that
none of these things are possible. In the first
place, it is well known that compressed air will
do exactly the same work in regaining its former
volume that was expended upon it to compress it,
and this with absolute exactness. In compressing
the gas with a piston the force exerted upon
the rod to drive the piston must be sufficient not
only to compress the gas but also to overcome the
friction of the tight fitting piston, and further, if
the pressure on the rod be removed, the expanding
gas will deliver against the face of the piston
exactly the force and energy required to drive
the piston for the compression, but not all of this
can be returned to any machinery driven by the
piston-rod, for a part will be lost in the friction of
the tight-fitting parts. Thus here, as elsewhere,
there is an exact equivalent of energy a part of
which is consumed in friction, and only a part
available for returned motion. The same thing
is true in compressing a bag, except that possibly
the bending of the fabric is less resistance than
the friction of the tight-fitting piston. Still, the
bending of the fabric is some resistance, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the bag so expanding cannot return all
the energy required for its compression, the difference
being the loss, however slight, in the
bending of the fabric of which the bag is made.</p>

<p>Again, let us admit that a dilated bag is
easily immersed in water, and that if inflated with
air there will be considerable tendency to rise, but
how much energy is required for the inflation?
It is manifest that if it is immersed the weight of
the water and its consequent pressure will resist
the attempted inflation, and must be overcome
before the inflation is complete. The deeper the
immersion the more the compression, and consequently
the more work required for the inflation.
If a bag having a contents of one cubic foot were
immersed a mile in fresh water, and if it should
be attempted to inflate it, the reader will perhaps
be surprised to know that the inflation would
have to be done against a pressure of substantially
2,400 pounds to the square inch. It is simple
that the deeper the bag is immersed the more
work it will do in rising to the surface, but it is
equally plain that the deeper it is immersed the
more energy is required for its inflation. In
each case the work of inflating is exactly equal to
the work returned in rising to the surface, and
there is not one whit to spare for running machinery
of any kind.</p>

<p>The third classes of devices above mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
assume atmospheric pressure, and a piston driven
by atmospheric pressure. This is easily attained,
but in order for atmospheric pressure to drive a
piston it must only be on one side of the piston,
and when the piston has been driven what force
and energy will be required to put it in a position
again such that there will be atmosphere on only
one side, and a vacuum into which it can retire,
on the other side? It is easily answered. The
same work must be done, and the same work exactly,
to put the piston again in the position with
the vacuum with equal dimensions into which it
can be driven by atmospheric pressure, that first
drove it to occupy the vacuum&mdash;exactly the same
work, and no less and no more, except that the
amount lost by friction must be supplied in addition.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAGNETIC DEVICES</span></h2>

<h3>A Magnetic Pendulum</h3>

<p>Here we present a device for Perpetual Motion
by magnetism, but we are unable to give the
inventor's name or his nativity. It seems to have
been brought forth in the early part of the nineteenth
century, prior to 1828. The description is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<div id="if_i_163" class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;"><img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="301" height="327" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Let A A, in the prefixed engraving, represent
two magnets revolving on axes. Let B represent
a larger magnet, hanging on an axis, pendulum
fashion, between the two former. As the poles
of the two smaller magnets lie in the same direction,
the effect will be to draw the larger magnet
towards that on the left hand, while it is at the
same time repelled by that on the right; but while
this is going on, the upper end of the large magnet
raises by means of a guide wire, the tumbler D,
which, just before the magnets come in contact,
passes the perpendicular and falls over, carrying
with it the lever connected with the two wheels
C C, and causing them to perform a quarter revolution;
these wheels are connected by lines with
two small wheels fixed on the axles of the two
magnets A A. While the former make a quarter
revolution, the latter turn half round; consequently,
the position of the magnets is reversed,
and the same motions are then performed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
pendulum magnet being attracted and repelled in
the opposite direction; and just before the magnets
touch each other the arrangement is again
instantly reversed.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Magnetic-Driven Wheel</h3>

<p>Another plan for Perpetual Motion by magnetism
appeared in the public journals of England
in 1828. The inventor states in effect that he desires
to get before the readers an</p>

<p>"Attempt at Perpetual Motion by Means of
Magnetism, Applied in a New Way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
His attempt as published is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The object of the present communication is
to lay before your readers an attempt at perpetual
motion by means of magnetism applied somewhat
differently to any that has yet been published
in your Magazine.</p>

<div id="if_i_164" class="figcenter" style="width: 173px;"><img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="173" height="187" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The above is a wheel of light construction,
moving on friction wheels <i>in vacuo</i>; the rim is
furnished with slips of steel&mdash;pieces of watch-spring
will do. N N are two magnets, which,
attracting the rim of the wheel, will render one
side lighter and the other heavier, causing it to
revolve <i>ad infinitum</i>: or to render it more powerful,
let the steel rims be magnetized and fixed on
the wheel with their north poles towards its center.
Let two more magnets be added, as shown
by the dotted lines: let these two, S S, be placed
with their south poles nearest the rim of the
wheel; and the other two, N N, with their north
poles in that position. Now, as similar poles
repel and opposite poles attract, the wheel will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
driven round by attraction and repulsion acting
conjointly on four points of its circumference.
B B are blocks of wood to keep off the attraction
of the magnets from that part of the wheel which
has passed them.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Mackintosh's Experiment</h3>

<p>F. S. Mackintosh, of England, in 1823,
sought to accomplish Perpetual Motion, and made
the attempt here described. It was not made
public until 1836, when it was published in "Mechanics'
Magazine." In the meantime, the inventor
had become convinced of the impossibility of
perpetual motion, as his comments on his own
alleged invention discloses.</p>

<p>(The classification in this book of Mackintosh's
invention is somewhat doubtful. The article
as contributed in 1836 would as aptly be
classified under arguments against Perpetual Motion,
Chapter XII. But, in view of the fact
that at the time of the invention the inventor was
seriously working at a scheme for the accomplishment
of Perpetual Motion, it has been decided to
classify it under Magnetic Perpetual Motion Devices.)</p>

<p>The published article was in the nature of a
contribution from the inventor, and is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I herewith forward you a description of a
machine which was constructed by me in the year
1823, with a view to produce a perpetual motion.
With this machine and the studies necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
connected with it, first originated the suspicion
that the planets could not continue in motion unless
they gradually approached the center of the
attraction.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us describe the machine.
Fig. 1: A is a sectional view of the interior of the
wheel, which is formed in two halves upon one
shaft; each half or section is furnished with a
projecting ledge and an opening is left between
the two ledges sufficiently wide to admit of a magnet
being introduced between them, by which arrangement
the magnet may be brought as near
to the ball as may be necessary (see Fig. 2). B
is a magnet whose line of attraction acts at right
angles with the line of gravity. C is an iron ball
under the action of two forces. The magnet continually
drawing the ball up the inclined plane
within the wheel, and gravity continually drawing
it to the bottom, by their united action it was
supposed the wheel would revolve forever, or till
it was worn out; upon the same principle that a
wheel revolves by the animal force or muscular
action of a mouse or squirrel, which carries it up
the inclined plane, whilst it is continually drawn
to the bottom by the action of gravity, thereby
causing the wheel to revolve by the weight of its
body. The model was taken from the earth's
motion round the sun; and the following process
of reasoning seemed to justify the assumption
that the wheel would move on till it was worn out:</p>

<p>"The earth is carried round the sun by the
action of two forces, one of which is momentum,
which is not, in reality, a force or cause of motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
but an effect derived from an original impulse;
and that impulse or the momentum derived
from it is not destroyed, because there is no resistance
to the moving body&mdash;that is, there is no
friction. Well, I cannot make this machine without
having resistance to the motion&mdash;that is, friction;
but to compensate for this I have two real
forces, two causes of motion, each of them
capable of imparting momentum to a body: they
are both constant forces; and from one of them,
the magnet, I can obtain any power that may be
required within certain limits."</p>

<div id="if_i_167" class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;"><img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="358" height="330" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
This reasoning appeared conclusive, and the
wheel was made; but when the magnet was applied
instead of the ball rolling up the inclined
plane, the wheel moved backwards upon its center.
It occurred to me that by placing a small
ratchet upon the wheel, as shown at D, this backward
motion of the wheel on its center might be
prevented, in which case the ball must roll up the
inclined plane, and that a perpetual motion might
then ensue; but this ratchet I never tried, having
about that time begun to perceive that the idea of
a perpetual mechanical motion, either on the earth
or in the heavens, involves an absurdity; and that,
therefore, the motions of the planets must necessarily
carry them continually nearer and nearer
to the center of attraction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above described device by Mr. Mackintosh
brought forth the following comment from
R. Munro, which was published in 1836:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The result of Mr. Mackintosh's essay at
perpetual motion might be attributed to the avoidable
friction caused by the manner in which the
iron ball is placed in the wheel. Curious to try the
experiment, I proceeded, and, with the view of
diminishing the friction, I placed two wheels on
the axis of the ball, but the result was precisely
that described by Mr. Mackintosh. I next applied
the ratchet, as suggested, but with no better
effect; the ball rolled towards the magnet, but
did not give the required motion to the wheel. It
is not unlikely, then, that the present ingenious
attempt will not be realized.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<h3>Spence's Device</h3>

<p>John Spence, of Linlithgow, Scotland, was a
shoemaker, but possessed great mechanical ingenuity.
He could not keep his mind from the
subject of mechanics. He devoted a great deal of
time to designing mechanical schemes for Perpetual
Motion. An account of his efforts is taken
from "Percy Anecdotes."</p>

<p>The device was exhibited in Edinburgh and
amazing to state it attracted the attention of one
of the greatest and most original scientists that
ever lived, Sir David Brewster.</p>

<p>It is from a letter written by Brewster, in
1818, to the "Annales de Chimie," that we get a
description of the Spence invention. The editor of
"Annales de Chimie," was evidently reluctant to
publish any article concerning Perpetual Motion,
and only the great fame of Sir David induced him
to give space to the contribution. The article was
first published in France, but it has, with an introductory
statement by the editor, been translated
into English, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reader will readily conclude that in publishing
this article we are influenced solely by the
great reputation of the learned contributor. Sir
David writes from Edinburgh:</p>

<div id="if_i_170a" class="figcenter" style="width: 203px;"><img src="images/i_170a.jpg" width="203" height="153" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>I am almost afraid to inform you that at this
moment in Edinburgh may be seen a machine,
made by a shoemaker at Linlithgow, which realizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
the perpetual motion. This effect is produced
by two magnets A and B, acting alternately upon
a needle <i>m n</i>, of which the point of attachment <i>n</i>
corresponds exactly with the axis around which
turns the movable lever C D. When the needle
<i>m n</i> has been attracted into the position <i>m´ n</i> by
the action of the magnet B, and C D is in consequence
found in C´ D´, a <i>substance</i> connected
with m n is interposed by mechanism between <i>m´
n</i> and B. This substance has the property of
intercepting, or rather of modifying the action
of the magnet B, and this permits the other magnet
A to draw the needle into the position <i>m´´ n</i>;
but no sooner has it reached this point than a
second plate or layer of the same substance places
itself before magnet, and immediately B attracts
anew the needle.</p>

<div id="if_i_170b" class="figcenter" style="width: 152px;"><img src="images/i_170b.jpg" width="152" height="72" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The annexed figure exhibits a second form
of the machine. A and B are two horse-shoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
magnets, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> the <i>mysterious substance</i>, and
<i>m n</i> the needle, which turns constantly with great
rapidity. Mr. Playfair and Capt. Kater have
inspected both of these machines, and are satisfied
that they resolve the problem of <i>perpetual
motion</i>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Joannis Theisneri's Semi-Circle</h3>

<p>An account of this invention has been preserved
by Gaspar Schott in a work entitled
"Thaumaturgus Physicus, sive Magiae Universalis
Naturae et Artis," published in 1859. It is
illustrated by the following figure:</p>

<div id="if_i_171" class="figcenter" style="width: 157px;"><img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="157" height="144" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The inventor expected the operation of his
device to be as follows: "A" is a large magnet,
elevated on a short pillar at the foot of which is
a straight inclined tube, "C" "F" the ends of
which are connected with a curved or semicircular
tube "C", "D", "E", "F", as shown in the
figure.</p>

<p>The weight at the lower extremity is supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
to ascend through the curved tube by the
attraction of the magnet "A" and upon reaching
the point "C" the supposition was that upon passing
the point "C" the attraction of the magnet
"A" would be sufficient to hold it there * * *
back to the point "F" through the straight tube,
and then be drawn by the magnet through the
curved tube to the point "C" and so on perpetually.</p>

<p>The impracticability of the above device is
manifest. At a point between "D" and "E" it is
plain the ball would have to ascend perpendicularly
and if the magnet exerts sufficient attraction
to elevate the weight at that point it would surely
hold the weight at the point "C", for at "C" the
weight would be much nearer the magnet and consequently
much more strongly attracted.</p>

<h3>Device of Dr. Jacobus</h3>

<p>In the same work by Gaspar Schott from
which an account of the preceding device is obtained
he gives an account of the device of Dr.
Jacobus.</p>

<p>Dr. Jacobus's scheme is illustrated by the
following figure:</p>

<div id="if_i_173" class="figcenter" style="width: 179px;"><img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="179" height="146" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>It will be observed that the above figure
shows a string of iron balls "A" suspended on a
grooved wheel "E" on an axle "C" between two
uprights "FF". At "H" lies a large lodestone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
which is to attract the balls at "D" and was expected
by the inventor to cause the wheel to rotate.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEVICES UTILIZING CAPILLARY ATTRACTION
AND PHYSICAL
AFFINITY</span></h2>

<h3>Ludeke and Wilckens's Device</h3>

<p>In 1864, Johann Ernst Friedrich Ludeke, of
London, and Daniel Wilckens, of Surrey, applied
for British patent on "Improvements in Motive
Power by Capillary Attraction." They describe
their invention as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our invention consists of improvements in
motive power by capillary attraction constructed
as follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_174" class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;"><img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="297" height="131" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings represents
in horizontal section a square case or cistern;
this cistern is filled with water nearly to
the top, and two wheels marked <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, and <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, are
placed in the water in the cistern. By capillary
attraction the water rises between the two wheels
marked <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, to a height above the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
water in proportion to the distance of the wheels
from each other at <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>. As the water rises between
the wheels marked <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, above its level, the
weight of water between the wheels at <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, will
cause the wheels to continually revolve.</p>

<p>Figure 2 represents the same as Figure 1,
but in a vertical section. The said power may be
obtained by wheels moved on axis, or by other
apparatus by rise and fall in the water by vertical
motion.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Jurin Device</h3>

<p>The device which we have designated "The
Jurin Device," was not, in fact, invented by Jurin.
James Jurin furnished an account of the invention
to The Royal Society of London, and it appears
in the reports of that society published in 1720.
The invention was by a friend of Jurin's whose
name he does not give in the account.</p>

<p>Jurin's account of his friend's invention is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some days ago a method was proposed to me
by an ingenious friend for making a perpetual
motion, which seemed so plausible, and indeed so
easily demonstrable from an observation of the
late Mr. Hawksbee, said to be grounded upon experiment,
that though I am far from having any
opinion of attempts of this nature, yet, I confess,
I could not see why it should not succeed. Upon
trial indeed I found myself disappointed. But
as searches after things impossible in themselves
are frequently observed to produce other discoveries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
unexpected by the Inventor; so this
Proposal has given occasion not only to rectify
some mistakes into which we had been led, by that
ingenious and useful member of the Royal Society
above named, but likewise to detect the real principle,
by which water is raised and suspended in
capillary tubes, above the level.</p>

<p>My friend's proposal was as follows:</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Let A B C be a capillary siphon,
composed of two legs A B, B C, unequal both in
length and diameter; whose longer and narrower
leg A B having its orifice A immersed in water,
the water will rise above the level, till it fills the
whole tube A B, and will then continue suspended.
If the wider and shorter leg B C, be in like manner
immersed, the water will only rise to same
height as F C, less than the entire height of the
tube B C.</p>

<p>This siphon being filled with water and the
orifice A sunk below the surface of the water D
E, my friend reasons thus:</p>

<p>Since the two columns of water A B and F C,
by the supposition, will be suspended by some
power acting within the tubes they are contained
in, they cannot determine the water to move one
way, or the other. But the column B F, having
nothing to support it, must descend, and cause the
water to run out at C. Then the pressure of the
atmosphere driving the water upward through
the orifice A, to supply the vacuity, which would
otherwise be left in the upper part of the tube B C,
this must necessarily produce a perpetual motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
since the water runs into the same vessel, out of
which it rises. But the fallacy of this reasoning
appears upon making the experiment.</p>

<div id="if_i_177" class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;"><img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="441" height="319" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Exp. 1. For the water, instead of running
out at the orifice C rises upwards towards F, and
running all out of the leg B C, remains suspended
in the other leg to the height A B.</p>

<p>Exp. 2. The same thing succeeds upon
taking the siphon out of the water, into which its
lower orifice A had been immersed, the water then
falling in drops out of the orifice A, and standing
at last at the height A B. But in making these
two experiments it is necessary that A G the difference
of the legs exceed F C, otherwise the
water will not run either way.</p>

<p>Exp. 3. Upon inverting the siphon full of
water, it continues without motion either way.</p>

<p>The reason of all which will plainly appear,
when we come to discover the principle, by which
the water is suspended in capillary tubes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawksbee's observation is as follows:</p>

<p>Fig. 2. Let A B F C be a capillary siphon,
into which the water will rise above the level to
the height C F, and let B A be the depth of the
orifice of its longer leg below the surface of the
water D E. Then the siphon being filled with
water, if B A be not greater than C F, the water
will not run out at A, but will remain suspended.</p>

<p>This seems indeed very plausible at first
sight. For since the column of water F C will be
suspended by some power within the tube, why
should not the column B A, being equal to, or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
than the former, continue suspended by the same
power.</p>

<p>Exp. 4. In fact, if the orifice C be lifted up
out of the water D E, the water in the tube will
continue suspended, unless B A exceed F C.</p>

<p>Exp. 5. But when C is never so little immersed
in the water immediately the water in the
tube runs out in drops at the orifice A, though
the length A B be considerably less than the
height C F.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawksbee, in his book of Experiments,
has advanced another observation, namely, that
the shorter leg of a capillary siphon, as A B F C,
must be immersed in the water to the depth F C,
which is equal to the height of the column, that
would be suspended in it, before the water will
run out of the longer leg.</p>

<p>Exp. 6. From what mistake this has proceeded,
I cannot imagine; for the water runs out
at the longer leg, as soon as the orifice of the
shorter leg comes to touch the surface of the stagnant
water, without being at all immersed therein.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jurin's attitude concerning his friend's discovery
is pleasing. He appears to have had better
judgment than to rush into print, or herald
forth that Perpetual Motion had been accomplished.
Indeed, the account as given to the Royal
Society was that of an experiment and a failure.
Nevertheless, it presents an interesting point.
Capillary Attraction, however, creates no new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
energy. Adhesion is a force, and is often quite a
strong force in nature.</p>

<p>If a rod or tube be held by the hand at one
end, and the other end inserted in a liquid, it will
be observed that in some instances, depending
upon the nature of the material of the rod or tube,
and the liquid, at the point of contact the liquid
will slightly rise in the tube and on the outside
edges of the tube. In other instances it will be
depressed slightly at the same point. Whether it
will be elevated or depressed depends on whether
the adhesion of the liquid to the material of which
the tube or rod is composed is greater than the
cohesion of the particles of the liquid.</p>

<p>If there be a depression it is manifest that
the entire surface of the liquid will be slightly elevated
by reason of the depression. On the contrary,
if the liquid adheres to and creeps slightly
upward on the tube or rod, then it is manifest that
the surface of the liquid will come to rest slightly
lower than though it did not so creep.</p>

<p>The net result finally gets back to the principle
of flotation. The immersion or insertion is
a little more difficult in the case of depression, and
a little easier in the case of elevation. There is
no gain or loss of energy. It simply increases in
one case, and diminishes in the other case the
amount of displacement, with all the resulting
mechanical phenomena.</p>

<h3>Sir William Congreve</h3>

<p>As stated in the preface of this work, pursuit
of Perpetual Motion has by no means been confined
to mechanics and tradesmen. Many men
eminent, and even famous in professions, art and
science have devoted much time and thought to
the subject. Among such eminent men is to be
mentioned Sir William Congreve, of England, a
baronet. He was born 1772, and died in 1828.
He was an artillerist and an inventor, and was a
son of Lieutenant General Sir William Congreve;
was distinguished as a military man, as a member
of parliament, and as a business man; was an
inventor of note, having invented a war rocket, a
gun-recoil mounting, a time-fuse, a parachute attachment
for rockets, a hydro-pneumatic canal
lock sluice, a process for color painting, a new
form of steam engine, a method of consuming
smoke, a clock which measured time by a ball rolling
down an inclined plane, besides other inventions
and discoveries. He published a large number
of works on scientific subjects.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, surprising that whatever
Sir William Congreve said or did concerning any
scientific or mechanical subject should have attracted
general attention.</p>

<p>He devised and made a Perpetual Motion
Machine, which, like all others, failed to work.
We submit that his plan is peculiarly ingenious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
and we fail to see how, without a knowledge of
the principles of Conservation of Energy, the
Congreve idea should not have appealed to any
one as reasonable, and its failure puzzling.</p>

<p>An account of the Congreve device and an
explanation of his ideas appeared in "The Atlas"
in 1827, and the following description is taken
from the article appearing in "The Atlas":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The celebrated Boyle entertained an idea
that perpetual motion might be obtained by means
of capillary attraction; and, indeed, there seems
but little doubt that nature has employed this
force in many instances to produce this effect.</p>

<p>There are many situations in which there is
every reason to believe that the sources of springs
on the tops and sides of mountains depend on the
accumulation of water created at certain elevations
by the operation of capillary attraction, acting
in large masses of porous material, or through
laminated substances. These masses being
saturated, in process of time become the sources
of springs and the heads of rivers; and thus, by
an endless round of ascending and descending
waters, form, on the great scale of nature, an
incessant cause of perpetual motion, in the purest
acceptance of the term, and precisely on the principle
that was contemplated by Boyle. It is probable,
however, that any imitation of this process
on the limited scale practicable by human art
would not be of sufficient magnitude to be effective.
Nature, by the immensity of her operations,
is able to allow for a slowness of process which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
would baffle the attempts of man in any direct
and simple imitation of her works. Working,
therefore, upon the same causes, he finds himself
obliged to take a more complicated mode to produce
the same effect.</p>

<p>To amuse the hours of a long confinement
from illness, Sir William Congreve has recently
contrived a scheme of perpetual motion, founded
on this principle of capillary attraction, which, it
is apprehended, will not be subject to the general
refutation applicable to those plans in which the
power is supposed to be derived from gravity
only. Sir William's perpetual motion is as follows:</p>

<div id="if_i_183" class="figcenter" style="width: 249px;"><img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="249" height="221" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Let A B C be three horizontal rollers fixed
in a frame; <i>a a a</i>, etc., is an endless band of
sponge, running round these rollers; and <i>b b b</i>,
etc., is an endless chain of weights, surrounding
the band of sponge, and attached to it, so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
must move together; every part of this band and
chain being so accurately uniform in weight that
the perpendicular side A B will, in all positions
of the band and chain, be in equilibrium with the
hypothenuse A C, on the principle of the inclined
plane. Now, if the frame in which these rollers
are fixed be placed in a cistern of water, having
its lower part immersed therein, so that the
water's edge cuts the upper part of the rollers B
C, then, if the weight and quantity of the endless
chain be duly proportioned to the thickness and
breadth of the band of sponge, the band and chain
will, on the water in the cistern being brought to
the proper level, begin to move round the rollers
in the direction A B, by the force of capillary attraction,
and will continue so to move. The
process is as follows:</p>

<p>On the side A B of the triangle, the weights
<i>b b b</i>, etc., hanging perpendicularly alongside the
band of sponge, the band is not compressed by
them, and its pores being left open, the water at
the point <i>x</i>, at which the band meets its surface,
will rise to a certain height, <i>y</i>, above its level, and
thereby create a load, which load will not exist on
the ascending side C A, because on this side the
chain of weights compresses the band at the
water's edge, and squeezes out any water that
may have previously accumulated in it; so that
the band rises in a dry state, the weight of the
chain having been so proportioned to the breadth
and thickness of the band as to be sufficient to
produce this effect. The load, therefore, on the
descending side A B, not being opposed by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
similar load on the ascending side, and the equilibrium
of the other parts not being disturbed by
the alternate expansion and compression of the
sponge, the band will begin to move in the direction
A B; and as it moves downwards, the accumulation
of water will continue to rise, and
thereby carry on a constant motion, provided the
load at <i>x y</i> be sufficient to overcome the friction
on the rollers A B C.</p>

<p>Now, to ascertain the quantity of this load
in any particular machine, it must be stated that
it is found by experiment that the water will rise
in a fine sponge about an inch above its level; if,
therefore, the band and sponge be one foot thick
and six feet broad, the area of its horizontal section
in contact with the water would be 864 square
inches, and the weight of the accumulation of
water raised by the capillary attraction being one
inch rise upon 864 square inches, would be 30
lbs., which, it is conceived, would be much more
than equivalent to the friction of the rollers.</p>

<p>The deniers of this proposition, on the first
view of the subject, will say, it is true the accumulation
of the weight on the descending side thus
occasioned by the capillary attraction would produce
a perpetual motion, if there were not as
much power lost on the ascending side by the
change of position of the weights, in pressing the
water out of the sponge.</p>

<p>The point now to be established is, that the
change in the position of the weights will not
cause any loss of power. For this purpose, we
must refer to the following diagram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<div id="if_i_186" class="figcenter" style="width: 229px;"><img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="229" height="230" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>With reference to this diagram, suppose
<i>a a a</i>, etc., an endless strap, and <i>b b b</i>, etc., an
endless chain running round the rollers; A B C
not having any sponge between them, but kept at
a certain distance from each other by small and
inflexible props, <i>p p p</i>, etc., then the sides A B
and C A would, in all positions of this system, be
precisely an equilibrium, so as to require only a
small increment of weight on either side to produce
motion. Now, we contend that this equilibrium
would still remain unaffected, if small
springs were introduced in lieu of the inflexible
props <i>p p p</i>, so that the chain <i>b b b</i> might approach
the lower strap <i>a a a</i>, by compressing these small
springs with its weight on the ascending side; for
although the centre of gravity of any portion of
chain would move in a different line in the latter
case&mdash;for instance, in the dotted line&mdash;still the
quantity of the actual weight of every inch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
strap and chain would remain precisely the same
in the former case, where they are kept at the
same distance in all positions, as in the latter case,
where they approach on the ascending side; and
so, also, these equal portions of weights, notwithstanding
any change of distance between their
several parts which may take place in one case
and not in the other, would in both cases rise and
fall, though the same perpendicular space, and
consequently the equilibrium, would be equally
preserved in both cases, though in the first case
they may rise and fall through rather more than
in the second. The application of this demonstration
to the machine described in Fig. 1, is obvious;
for the compression of the sponge by the sinking
of the weights on the ascending side, in pressing
out the water, produces precisely the same effect
as to the position and ascent of the weights, as the
approach of the chain to the lower strap on the
ascending side, in Fig. 2, by the compression of
the springs; and consequently, if the equilibrium
is not affected in one case&mdash;that is, in Fig. 2, as
above demonstrated&mdash;it will not be affected in the
other case, Fig. 1; and, therefore, the water would
be squeezed out by the pressure of the chain without
any loss of power. The quantity of weight
necessary for squeezing dry any given quantity
of sponge must be ascertained and duly apportioned
by experiment. It is obvious, however,
that whether one cubic inch of sponge required
one, two, or four ounces for this purpose, it would
not affect the equilibrium, since, whatever were
the proportion on the ascending side, precisely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
same would the proportion be on the descending
side.</p>

<p>This principle is capable of application in
various ways, and with a variety of materials. It
may be produced by a single roller or wheel.
Mercury may also be substituted for water, by
using a series of metallic plates instead of
sponges; and, as the mercury will be found to rise
to a much greater height between these plates,
than water will do in a sponge, it will be found
that the power to be obtained by the latter materials
will be from 70 to 80 times as great as by
the use of water. Thus, a machine, of the same
dimensions as given above, would have a constant
power of 2,000 lbs. acting upon it.</p>

<p>We now proceed to show how the principle
of perpetual motion proposed by Sir William Congreve
may be applied upon one centre instead of
three.</p>

<p>In the following figure, <i>a b c d</i> represents a
drum-wheel or cylinder, moving on a horizontal
axis surrounded with a band of sponge 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8, and immersed in water, so that the surface of
the water touches the lower end of the cylinder.
Now then, if, as in Fig. 2, the water on the
descending side <i>b</i> be allowed to accumulate in the
sponge at <i>x</i>, while, on the ascending side D, the
sponge at the water's edge shall, by any means
not deranging the equilibrium, be so compressed
that it shall quit the water in a dry state, the
accumulation of water above its level at <i>x</i>, by the
capillary attraction, will be a source of constant
rotary motion; and, in the present case, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
be found that the means of compressing the
sponge may be best obtained by buoyancy, instead
of weight.</p>

<p>For this purpose, therefore, the band of
sponge is supposed to be divided into eight or
more equal parts, 1 2 3 4, etc., each part being
furnished with a float or buoyant vessel, <i>f</i> 1, <i>f</i> 2,
etc., rising and falling upon spindles, <i>s s s</i>, etc.,
fixed in the periphery of the drum; these floats
being of such dimensions that, when immersed in
water, the buoyancy or pressure upwards of each
shall be sufficient to compress that portion of the
sponge connected with it, so as to squeeze out
any water it may have absorbed. These floats
are further arranged by means of levers <i>l l l</i>, etc.,
and plates <i>p p p</i>, etc., so that, when the float <i>f</i> No.
1 becomes immersed in the water, its buoyant
pressure upwards acts not against the portion of
the sponge No. 1, immediately above it, but
against No. 2, next in front of it; and so, in like
manner, the buoyancy of <i>f</i> No. 2 float acts on the
portion of the sponge No. 3, and <i>f</i> No. 3 float
upon No. 4 sponge.</p>

<p>Now, from this arrangement it follows, that
the portion of sponge No. 4, which is about to quit
the water, is pressed upon by that float, which,
from acting vertically, is most efficient in squeezing
the sponge dry; while that portion of the
sponge No. 1, on the point of entering the water,
is not compressed at all from its corresponding
float No. 8, not having yet reached the edge of the
water. By these means, therefore, it will be seen
that the sponge always rises in a dry state from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the water on the ascending side, while it approaches
the water on the descending side in an
uncompressed state, and open to the full action of
absorption by the capillary attraction.</p>

<div id="if_i_190" class="figcenter" style="width: 221px;"><img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="221" height="205" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The great advantage of effecting this by the
buoyancy of light vessels instead of a burthen of
weights, as in Fig. 2, is that, by a due arrangement
of the dimensions and buoyancy of the floats
immersed, the whole machine may be made to
float on the surface of the water, so as to take off
all friction whatever from the centre of suspension.
Thus, therefore, we have a cylindrical machine
revolving on a single centre without friction,
and having a collection of water in the
sponge on the descending side, while the sponge
on the ascending side is continually dry; and if
this cylinder be six feet wide, and the sponge that
surrounds it one foot thick, there will be a constant
moving power of thirty pounds on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
descending side, without any friction to counteract
it.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that to perpetuate
the motion of this machine, the means used to
leave the sponge open on the descending side,
and press it dry on the ascending side, must be
such as will not derange the equilibrium of the
machine when floating in water. As, therefore,
in this case the effect is produced by the ascent of
the buoyant floats <i>b</i>, to demonstrate the perpetuity
of the motion, we must show that the ascent of the
floats <i>f</i> No. 1 and <i>f</i> No. 3 will be equal in all corresponding
situations on each side of the perpendicular;
for the only circumstance that could
derange the equilibrium on this system, would be
that <i>f</i> No. 1 and <i>f</i> No. 3 should not in all such
corresponding situations approach the centre of
motion equally; for it is evident that in the position
of the floats described in the above figure, if
<i>f</i> No. 1 float did not approach the centre as much
as <i>f</i> No. 3, the equilibrium would be destroyed,
and the greater distance of <i>f</i> No. 1 from the
centre than that of f No. 3 would create a resistance
to the moving force caused by the accumulation
of the water at <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>It will be found, however, that the floats <i>f</i>
No. 1 and <i>f</i> No. 3 do retain equal distances from
the centre in all corresponding situations, for the
resistance to their approach to the centre by
buoyancy is the elasticity of the sponge at the
extremity of the respective levers; and as this
elasticity is the same in all situations, while this
centrifugal force of the float <i>f</i> No. 1 is equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
that of the float <i>f</i> No. 3, at equal distances from
the perpendicular, the floats <i>f</i> No. 1 and <i>f</i> No. 3
will, in all corresponding situations on either side
of the perpendicular, be at equal distances from
the centre. It is true, that the force by which
these floats approach the centre of motion varies
according to the obliquity of the spindles on which
they work, it being greatest in the perpendicular
position; but, as the obliquity of these spindles is
the same at all equal distances from the perpendicular,
and as the resistance of the ascent of the
floats is equal in all cases, the center of buoyancy
will evidently describe a similar curve on each
side of the perpendicular; and consequently the
equilibrium will be preserved, so as to leave a
constant moving force at <i>x</i>, equal to the whole
accumulation of water in the sponge. Nor will
this equilibrium be disturbed by any change of
position in the floats not immersed in the water,
since, being duly connected with the sponge by
the levers and plates, they will evidently arrange
themselves at equal distances from the center, in
all corresponding situations on either side.</p>

<p>It may be said that the equilibrium of the
band of sponge may be destroyed by its partial
compression; and it must be admitted that the
centre of gravity of the part compressed, according
to the construction above described, does approach
the center of motion nearer than the center
of gravity of the part not compressed. The whole
weight of the sponge is, however, so inconsiderable,
that this difference would scarcely produce
any sensible effect; and if it did, a very slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
alteration in the construction, by which the
sponge should be compressed as much outwards
as inwards, would retain the center of gravity of
the compressed part at the same distance from
the center of motion as the center of gravity of
the part not compressed.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">Liquid Air as a Means of Perpetual Motion</span></h2>

<p>A few years ago air was liquefied. This was
accomplished by a very high compression accompanied
by a very low temperature.</p>

<p>It is manifest that when liquid air is removed
from the extremely low temperature necessary
for its liquefaction, and introduced into ordinary
atmospheric temperatures, it will exert a most
tremendous expansive force which can be utilized
for driving machinery and thereby producing
heat or electricity, or for any other purpose for
which force is required. But, by the law of Conservation
of Energy, the liquefied air by expansion
can yield no more energy than was required
to extract the heat from the air and compress it
into the liquid state.</p>

<p>One enthusiastic individual who had worked
in a plant for liquefying air announced throughout
the United States of America, and perhaps
throughout the civilized world, that he had a
device by which the expansive force of three
pounds of liquid air could be made to liquefy ten
pounds, and that seven of the ten could be utilized
for driving machinery, or for any other purpose
for which force is required, the remaining three
being utilized in the production of another ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
pounds of liquid air, and so on ad infinitum. He
boldly announced that thereby he had discovered
an inexhaustible supply of energy at a nominal
cost, whereby we could all be warmed and have
our machinery of all kinds driven without the
expense of gas, coal, fuel of any kind, wind,
waves, tides or streams. This enthusiastic individual
produced considerable excitement for a
time, and then the public ceased to hear about
either him or his device. He dropped out of sight
and his name sank into oblivion. His claims were
absurd, and the absurdity is readily apparent to
anyone versed in thermodynamics or familiar
with the principles of Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>There was little excuse for his ever having
made such pretentions or for his pretentions ever
to have been seriously listened to by any one; for
the principle of Conservation of Energy had
years before been fully established and heralded
throughout the world.</p>

<span class="subhead">Radium and Radio-Active Substances Considered
as a Conceived Source of
Perpetual Motion</span></h2>

<p>A few years ago when the remarkable properties
of radium were discovered it was thought
by many that here at last was the long sought
solution of the problem of Perpetual Motion.
Radium seemed to have the power of maintaining
its own temperature <i>permanently</i> above that
of surrounding bodies. Many versed in the science
of thermodynamics (heat power) shook their
heads in doubt. If, indeed, it were really true
that the substance, radium, or any other substance
had the quality of remaining permanently warmer
than surrounding bodies without having heat supplied
to it, then, indeed, there was an inexhaustible
supply of heat, and consequently power.</p>

<p>Hon. R. J. Strutt (Lord Rayleigh), devised
a radium clock to run on this principle, consisting
of a vacuum vessel in which was suspended a
radio-active substance contained in a tube. At
the lower end of the tube are two gold leaves as
in an electroscope. Platinum wires extended
through the glass and touched the gold leaves.
The other end of the platinum wires are extended
to connect with the earth. The radio-active substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
electrifies the gold leaves and causes them
to be extended, and upon being extended they
come in contact with the platinum wires and their
charge of electricity is lost, being conducted
through the wires and dispersed in the earth, and
the leaves losing their charge fall by the force of
gravity from the wires back to their position near
the tube containing the radio-active substance to
be again charged, to again move to and touch the
platinum wires, and again lose their charge; this
process to go on indefinitely.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was Perpetual Motion, except
for the fact that further and more refined experiments
and investigations demonstrated that
radio-active substances are not permanently
radio-active, but gradually, though very slowly,
lose their radio-activity just as a fire will finally
burn out, no matter how slowly it burns, or just
as an electric battery will finally lose its charge
and become exhausted.</p>

<p>This loss, however, of radio-active energy in
radio-active substances is so slow that it is said
the Strutt clock will run for over one thousand
years. But the fact that it will not run permanently,
and that the motion is the result of energy
supplied by the radio-active substance, and is not
supplied by the mechanism itself, deprives it of
any right to be called a solution of the problem
of self-motive power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
It should be noted that Hon. R. J. Strutt
(Lord Rayleigh) of England, who devised the
radium clock, above mentioned, is not to be
classed with the ordinary Perpetual Motion enthusiast.
He was, and is, in fact, a man of very
great scientific ability and attainments, and has
to his credit many actual and splendid achievements
demonstrating him to be a genius of the
rarest and most exalted type. His radium clock
is founded on correct principles, and surely a clock
that will run one thousand years without having
power supplied from an outside source is worth
while. It should be here also mentioned that the
force derived from radio-activity in the manner
it is applied in the Strutt clock is very slight, and
the instrument necessarily extremely delicate.</p>

<span class="subhead">Perpetual Motion Devices Attempting Its Attainment
by a Misconception of the Relation
of Momentum and Energy</span></h2>

<p>The author, within twenty years last past,
has had his attention called by two different persons,
each ignorant of the efforts of the other,
who were seeking to obtain Perpetual Motion by
utilizing certain physical facts concerning Momentum
and Energy. These facts and the principles
out of which they grow are familiar to all
who understand thoroughly, even the rudiments
of physics; but to persons who are inclined to
mechanics, but who have never had the advantages
of the presentation of clear principles, they
are confusing, and it is surprising that they have
not become more fertile fields for Perpetual Motion
workers. However, we are unable to find
any written or printed account or description of
a plan or device of that kind, and our information
is confined to instances that have been brought
to our personal observation, and concerning
which the advice and counsel of the author was
sought.</p>

<p>The worker in each case was a man of more
than ordinary natural intelligence, and with a
bent for mechanical pursuits and reflection. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
had taken a course in what is conventionally
called High School Physics.</p>

<p>The idea in each case was so novel and interesting
that we deem the presentation worth while.
They were so nearly alike that instead of attempting
to narrate what they said, we will endeavor
in our own way to present the idea, and then to
give our explanation, showing wherein lay their
error.</p>

<p>The following definitions and laws of
physics may be regarded as established:</p>

<h3>Momentum</h3>

<p><i>Momentum</i> is the quantity of motion of a
moving body, and is the velocity multiplied by the
weight.</p>

<p>Thus, a body weighing two pounds, moving
at four feet per second, may be represented as
having a momentum of eight.</p>

<p>A body weighing two pounds moving at the
rate of six feet per second may be said to have a
momentum of twelve.</p>

<p>A body weighing ten pounds moving at the
rate of ten feet per second will have a momentum
of one hundred&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>Now, a step further. A body in motion
striking another body free to move will lose part
of its motion, and will impart some of its motion
to the body moved against. The aggregate momentum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
after the striking is the same as before&mdash;that
is to say&mdash;if a body weighing ten pounds
have a velocity of twenty feet per second, its
momentum we will call two hundred. Now, if
in moving it strike another body either larger or
smaller its motion will be somewhat retarded, and
the body struck will possess some motion.</p>

<p>Multiply the weight of each by its motion
after the striking, and it will be found that the
sum of the products is two hundred. This may
be illustrated by swinging balls like pendulums
to cords of equal length from a beam, having the
arrangement such that balls of different materials
and sizes can be substituted at liberty. If a body
be drawn back parallel to the beam, and released
so as to swing against another swinging body,
both will have motion. This motion will, in some
cases be a rebounding motion, as in the case of a
small elastic body swinging against and striking
a larger elastic body, but in all cases the sum total
of the momentum after the impingement is the
same as before.</p>

<p>The following statement of the law then, is
deducible:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The Momentum</i> of one body in motion may
be made to impart momentum to another body,
the amount of momentum lost by the former being
exactly equal to that thus acquired by the
latter.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Before leaving these remarks on momentum
the reader should observe carefully what momentum
is and bear in mind it is the <i>quantity of motion</i>
possessed by a moving body, and has to do
only with <i>mass</i> and <i>velocity</i>&mdash;and takes no account
of distance passed through.</p>

<h3>Energy</h3>

<p>Energy is the <i>capacity to do work</i>, and the
energy of a moving body is the amount of <i>work</i>
it will do, i. e., the <i>distance</i> it will move against a
resistance by virtue of its tendency to move, before
being brought to a state of rest.</p>

<p>Now note, and note carefully, that the
amount of <i>energy is proportional</i> to the mass, and
to the <i>square</i> of the velocity.</p>

<p>Note this carefully: Any body in motion
<i>has both momentum and energy</i>. Its momentum
is proportional to its velocity; its energy to the
<i>square</i> of its velocity. If the velocity be doubled,
the momentum will be doubled, but its energy
quadrupled. If the velocity be trebled, its momentum
will be trebled, but its energy increased
nine-fold.</p>

<p>It is important that the student get clearly
what is meant by saying that Energy is the
<i>capacity to do work</i>, and is proportional to the
square of the velocity.</p>

<p>The capacity to do work means the capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
to move against resistance, i. e., to overcome resistance.
The word "work" being used in a purely
mechanical sense and in that sense it is used
whether the result accomplished is destructive or
beneficial.</p>

<p>A revolving fly wheel will run machinery for
some time after the application of force has
ceased. This is doing work, and represents energy.</p>

<p>A bullet fired from a gun will accomplish
destruction before having its motion arrested.
This is work&mdash;energy.</p>

<p>If a boy throw a ball into a snow bank, its
motion will sink it into the snow, but not far, the
resistance of the snow will soon bring the ball to
rest. The ball overcomes resistance in passing
through the snow until it is brought to rest, and
thus it does the <i>work</i> of forcing itself through
the snow, and possesses the <i>energy</i> necessary to
do that work.</p>

<p>The overcoming of the resistance of the air
by a moving body is work. A steamboat will
move for some time in water after the steam has
been turned off. The overcoming of the resistance
of the water is work, and by virtue of the
motion of the boat when the steam was turned off
it possessed the energy to do the work of forcing
itself for some time through the resistance of the
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
The Perpetual Motion worker in each case
had reasoned himself into this conclusion: That
the same energy will impart the same <i>acceleration</i>
of velocity, regardless of the velocity at the beginning
of the application of energy. That the
same amount of energy or work necessary to impart
to a body a velocity of ten feet per second
will increase that velocity to twenty feet per
second, or from twenty feet per second to thirty
feet per second. In other words, that the same
amount of energy, and only the same amount of
energy is required for a given <i>increase</i> in velocity
without regard to the initial velocity. This appears
plausible, and almost self-evident. We believe
the great majority of people, other than
mechanical engineers would, upon presentation of
the theory accept it as axiomatic, and as a matter
of course. The fallacy becomes manifest only
from a critical and technical examination of the
Laws of Momentum and Energy.</p>

<p>The Perpetual Motion worker had learned
from his text-books that if the velocity be <i>doubled</i>,
the energy would be <i>multiplied by four</i>. His idea
was to so arrange his mechanism that he would
apply the amount of energy to move a fly wheel
free to revolve, from a position of rest to a revolving
velocity of ten revolutions per second. Then
apply again the <i>same amount of energy</i>, and accelerate
that velocity from ten revolutions per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
second to twenty revolutions per second. Thus,
the energy at the end of the second second would
be four times what it was at the end of the first
second. But to make it so, only double the amount
of energy had been applied that had been expended
at the end of the first second. Thus, he
reasoned, his machine was by virtue of its structure,
accumulating energy, and this energy could
be used one-half to continue the motion of his
machine, and the other half to run other machinery,
or for any other purpose for which
energy might be desired.</p>

<p>Wherein lies the fallacy of this supposition?</p>

<p>We will now endeavor to explain. And for
the young student to get the explanation fully, it
will be necessary for him to pay the closest attention
to what we here state.</p>

<p>A force, for instance the pressure of the
finger or the hand, equal to one pound against a
body free to move, will, we will say, move that
body in one second of time through a space of
ten feet, and at the end of that second the body
will have a velocity of twenty feet. It is manifest
that at the end of the second the velocity will be
twenty feet per second for its initial velocity is
zero, and its average velocity ten feet per second,
the acceleration being, of course, presumed uniform.</p>

<p>Now, it is <i>not</i> true as the Perpetual Motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
worker had assumed that the same energy&mdash;i. e.,
the same work that is required to increase the
velocity from zero to ten feet per second will increase
the velocity from ten feet per second to
twenty feet per second, and <i>in that assumption</i> lay
the fallacy of our friends who were thus seeking
Perpetual Motion.</p>

<p>The greater the velocity, the more energy is
required to impart a given acceleration. To increase
the velocity from ten feet per second to
twenty feet per second, the applied force must
continue through one second of time, and more
energy is required to follow a rapidly moving
body, and continue to apply to it a given force for
one second than would be required to follow and
maintain the application of the same force to a
body moving more slowly&mdash;the <i>distance</i> traveled
is greater in one case than in the other.</p>

<p>It must be plain that if the moving body have
a velocity at the end of the first second of twenty
feet per second, it will, at the end of the second
second, with the same pressure (force) continued
against the same resistance, have a velocity of
forty feet per second, and at the end of three seconds
have a velocity of sixty feet, and at the
end of four seconds a velocity of eighty feet, and
so on.</p>

<p>Now, at the beginning of the second second it
had a velocity of twenty feet, and at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
that second a velocity of forty feet. It therefore,
traveled through that second with an average velocity
of thirty feet and, of course, during the second
second traveled exactly thirty feet. It traveled
ten feet the first second, and if it traveled thirty
feet the second, then in the two seconds it traveled
forty feet&mdash;four times as far as it traveled the
first second. At the beginning of the third second
it had a velocity of forty feet, and at the end of the
third second a velocity of sixty feet. The average
velocity then for the third second would be one-half
the sum of forty feet and plus sixty feet&mdash;that
is to say, it would be fifty feet, and that
would be the distance traveled during the third
second. The first second it traveled ten feet, the
second second thirty feet, and the third second
fifty feet, making a total in three seconds of
ninety feet&mdash;that is to say, in three seconds it
traveled nine times as far as in one second.</p>

<p>It will be noticed from the above that the
velocity is proportional to the number of seconds,
but that the distance traveled is proportional to
the <i>square</i> of the number of seconds, and also
proportional to the square of the velocity.</p>

<p>Momentum is mass multiplied by velocity;
energy is measured by the distance through which
a body will move against a given resistance.</p>

<p>Should you prop up one wheel of a carriage
and revolve the wheel, then with the pressure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the finger or the thumb on the hub as a brake,
stop it, it will be found that (omitting the effect of
atmospheric resistance), the wheel will make four
times as many revolutions before stopping with
a doubled velocity; nine times as many with a
trebled velocity.</p>

<p>Falling bodies afford the most perfect illustration
of the principle of Momentum and Energy,
and are so commonly used to illustrate those
principles that many students get the idea that
the application of those principles is confined to
falling bodies, and do not realize that they extend
generally through the field of mechanics.</p>

<p>A falling body is, of course, acted upon by
gravity with uniform force equal to the weight
of the falling body, and that force continues to
follow the falling body and to be applied uniformly
and equally, however slowly, or rapidly
the body may be falling. And, omitting atmospheric
resistance, the body is absolutely free to
move except for its natural tendency to remain at
rest, or at uniform velocity. It is well known
that a body falls (almost exactly) sixteen feet in
one second, and at the end of one second has a
velocity of thirty-two. During the second second
it falls through a distance of forty-eight feet, and
during the third second a distance of eighty feet.
In two seconds it falls sixty-four feet, and in three
seconds one hundred twenty-eight feet, and so on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Thus, it will be observed that the <i>velocity</i> is proportional
to the time during which it has fallen,
but that the distance fallen in any number of
seconds is proportional to the <i>square</i> of the time.</p>

<p>This, indeed, is a property of numbers, and
results from mathematical law. If the reader
will form a series of numbers, setting down any
number for the first term of the series, adding to
it its double for the second term, and adding to
the second term double the first term for the third,
and adding double the first term to the third term
for the fourth, and so on&mdash;in other words, form
any increasing arithmetical series with double the
first term for the common difference, he will discover
that the <i>sum of all the terms is equal to the
first term multiplied by the square of the number
of terms</i>. Thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="center-table">
<table id="terms" summary="Terms incrementing by 10">
  <tr class="smaller">
    <td class="tdc">1st Term</td>
    <td class="tdc">2nd Term</td>
    <td class="tdc">3rd Term</td>
    <td class="tdc">4th Term</td>
    <td class="tdc">5th Term</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">5</td>
    <td class="tdc">15</td>
    <td class="tdc">25</td>
    <td class="tdc">35</td>
    <td class="tdc">45</td></tr>
</table></div></div>

<p>In the above series the sum of the first two
terms is 20, which is 4 times the first term. The
sum of the first three terms, i. e., 5 + 15 + 25 =
45-nine times the first term. The sum of the
first four terms, i. e., 5 + 15 + 25 + 35 = 80,
sixteen times the first term, and so on.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Momentum and
Energy are entirely different, although co-related;
that momentum relates to velocity, which
includes the element of time, whereas energy relates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
to the amount of work done, and may be
represented by a force operating against a certain
resistance, through a certain distance, entirely
irrespective of time. The energy is the
same with the same force operating against the
same resistance, through the same distance
whether the time consumed be great or small. It
takes as much energy in the aggregate to wind up
a bucket from the bottom of the well if done
slowly as if done quickly.</p>

<p>It would seem hardly necessary to do so, and
yet it is worth while remarking that the amount
of energy necessary to impart a given motion is
exactly the amount of Energy that will be required
to arrest that motion, and represents the
amount of Energy possessed by the moving body
by virtue of its motion. Work done, i. e., Energy
applied in giving motion is there in that motion,
ready to be returned in exactly an equal quantity&mdash;no
more&mdash;no less.</p>

<p>In all the considerations in this chapter no
notice is taken of loss by friction or atmospheric
resistance. We are considering pure mechanics
and the laws governing them only. In actual
mechanical devices it is always necessary to make
allowance for atmospheric, frictional and other
unavoidable resistances.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Alleged Inventions of Edward Sommerset,
Sixth Earl and Second Marquis of Worcester,
and of Jean Ernest Eli-Bessler
(Councillor) Orffyreus</span></h2>

<p>More interest has been taken, and more has
been said and written concerning the claimed inventions
of the men forming the subject of this
chapter than of all other Perpetual Motion devices
known to history. The reason is not difficult
to explain. It was the rank and eminence of
the inventors and of others whom they induced
to take an interest in their inventions, and to
proclaim them to the world. Intrinsically, neither
their claims nor their devices are entitled to any
more notice than are those of the humblest
mechanic that ever labored to attain Perpetual
Motion. However, so much has been said and
written concerning them that they have an historical
value and interest. Then, too, the interest
taken in their inventions brought forth some
splendid discussions which necessarily involve in
a general way, at least, the entire question of
Self-Motive Power. The historical interest attaching
to their inventions and the discussions
concerning them, entitles them to more than a
passing notice in this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
They were not co-laborers; they were not
even compatriots, nor contemporaries. Worcester
was an Englishman and Orffyreus a Frenchman,
though most of his labors were in what is
now Germany. The former died thirteen years
before the latter was born.</p>

<p>Edward Sommerset, of England, Sixth Earl
and Second Marquis of Worcester, was born in
the year 1601, and died in 1667. He was famous
not only for his noble birth and family rank, but
for personal attainments. He was the author of
a work entitled "Century of Names and Scantlings
of Such Inventions as at Present I Can Call
to Mind Have Tried and Perfected" (1663),
which has often been reprinted, and is usually
referred to simply as "Century Inventions." He
was very prominent in public life; was greatly
interested in mechanical experiments, and made
valuable suggestions, inventions and improvements
in connection with the use of steam as a
motive power.</p>

<p>Henry Dircks, who is so frequently mentioned
in this book, wrote a book which was published
in 1865, entitled "Life, Times and Scientific
Labors of the Second Marquis of Worcester."
The Marquis appears to have been all his life
greatly interested in science, mechanics and
mathematical contrivances. His first wife died
in 1635, and it seems probable that thenceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
he became and remained more than ever devoted
to mechanics, and sometime after that period announced
a successful Perpetual Motion machine,
the gist of all known information concerning
which appears from the articles and discussions
hereinafter set forth in this chapter.</p>

<p>Jean-Ernest Eli-Bessler (Councillor) Orffyreus
was born in 1680, near Zittan, Alsace,
France. He was a man of great ability and attained
an eminent place in public life. The title
"Councillor," he acquired by having been selected
Councillor to the Prince of Hesse Castle. The
best information concerning him indicates that
he was of very erratic temperament, given to fits
of melancholy and extreme anger. In early life
he was a student of theology and medicine, but his
penchant was really for mechanics. He claimed
that in his search for whatever might prove curious
and valuable he had discovered Perpetual
Motion, and that between the years 1712 and
1719 he had made two successfully working
machines on his system. The following discussions
disclose all that is known of the claimed
inventions of these two distinguished Perpetual
Motion workers.</p>

<p>The alleged inventions of the Marquis of
Worcester is stated by him in the 56th article of
his book entitled "Century of Names and Scantlings
of Such Inventions as at Present I Can Call
to Mind to Have Tried and Perfected," and translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
from the ancient English style in which his
book is written into modern style of English,
reads as follows:</p>

<p>The inventor offers the accompanying
sketch, with description of an Hydraulic Mover,
for communicating power to machinery, and recently
invented by <span class="locked">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To provide and make that all the weights of
the descending side of a wheel, shall be perpetually
farther from the center, than those of
the mounting side, and yet equal in number and
heft to the one side as the other. A most incredible
thing, if not seen; but tried before the late
King (of blessed memory) in the Tower by my
directions, two extraordinary ambassadors accompanying
his Majesty, and the Duke of Richmond,
and Duke of Hamilton, with most of the
Court attending him. The wheel was fourteen
foot over, and had forty weights of fifty pounds
apiece. Sir William Balfore, then Lieutenant of
the Tower, can justify it, with several others.
They all saw, that no sooner these great weights
passed the diameter line of the lower side, but they
hung a foot farther from the center; nor no
sooner passed the diameter line of the upper side,
but they hung a foot nearer. Be pleased to judge
of the consequence."</p></blockquote>

<p>In October of 1719, Orffyreus published a
small book, or pamphlet, both in German and
Latin, entitled "Perpetual Motion Triumphant,
by Orffyreus." The book commences:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>It is a notorious fact that Perpetual Motion
has not only been sought after by ingenious
mathematicians and artists with more or less expense,
but many have arisen here and there pretending
that they have made the discovery.
Nevertheless, it appears that to carry out this
most subtle mechanical idea, namely, to make a
dead material not only move itself, but lift
weights and perform work, even the most profound
mathematicians and the most learned
people have continually fallen into error. It is
no less notorious that those who have so sought,
not only refuse their consent, but have set their
seal on the discovery as an unsolvable problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>On a subsequent page he proceeds thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I, at last, an unworthy man, was made
an instrument in God's hands to solve this long-looked-for
and valuable secret, and to give a representation,
proposition and instruction on this
rare invention; also to publish and propound it to
all the world, no longer do I doubt, nay I presume,
that as the discoverer I possess it, after
many years of scrupulous doubts, much calumny
and exasperation from all my enemies.</p></blockquote>

<p>He speaks of his opponents under four divisions:
First, the scientific world; second, persons
in high authority; third, the public in general; and
fourth, the press;&mdash;observing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now my wish was to convince the world that
this illiberal, rude and inhuman treatment was
false, yet God's providence has brought to my
help, protection and succour the mighty Prince
Lord Charles, Landgrave of Hesse.</p></blockquote>

<p>On a subsequent page he indulges in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
sycophantic adulation of the Prince of
Hesse Castle, and suggestion of the description
of his claimed device:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It has not only pleased this mighty Prince to
protect me against my numerous enemies, but also
to give me house-room in his princely Castle of
Weissenstein, near Cassel; to name me one of his
most honored servants, and restore me in a measure
all the honor and means that I had lost in my
native country; wishing no doubt to give to
Hessin Cassel the high honor which belonged to
Saxony by right. In gratitude for all these gracious
acts, I consented to give another example of
my Perpetuum Mobile machine. I put all in
fresh order, and began work in all possible haste,
doing everything in the manner of those I had
already made and destroyed, with only a few
changes in the dimensions of the so-named turning-wheel.
For as a grindstone may be called a
wheel, so may the principal part of my machine be
named. The outward part of this wheel is drawn
over or covered with waxed linen in the form of
a drum. This cylindrical basis was 12 Rhenish
feet in diameter, the thickness from 15 to 18
inches, the middle axle 6 feet long and 8 inches
in thickness. It is supported in its movement on
two pointed steel balance-pegs, each 1 inch thick;
and the wheel is vertically suspended. The
movement is modified by two pendulums, as
shown in the engraving at the end of this book.
The inward structure of the wheel is of a nature
according to the laws of mechanical perpetual
motion, so arranged that by disposed weights once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
in rotation they gain force from their own swinging,
and must continue their movement as long as
their structure does not lose its position and arrangement.
Unlike all other automata, such as
clocks or springs or other hanging weights which
require winding up or whose duration depends on
the chain which attaches them, on the contrary,
these weights are the essential parts and constitute
perpetuum mobile itself; as from them is
received the universal movement which they must
exercise so long as they remain out of the center
of gravity; and when they come to be placed together,
and so arranged one against another that
they can never obtain equilibrium, or the <i>punctum
quietus</i> which they unceasingly seek in their wonderous
speedy flight, one or other of them must
apply its weight vertically to the axis, which in
its turn will also move.</p></blockquote>

<p>The author and inventor then suggests the
following uses of his machine: "raising weights,
raising stampers, water," etc. He criticises all
critics of his scheme and denounces them as cunning
rogues, and fools who are contemptibly endeavoring
to overthrow an incontestable fact.
He makes a quadrupled dedication of his device:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>1. To God,</li>
<li>2. To the Public in General,</li>
<li>3. To Men of Learning,</li>
<li>4. To Himself as Discoverer,</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">and he very modestly suggests a method by which
he could be approached on the subject of selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the secret of his machine for one hundred thousand
rix-thalers, and points out the great importance
to the public of such an acquisition. The
book contains a cut of his device with the following
very brief explanation:</p>

<p>In 1720 the following article was contributed
to and published in the "Gentleman's Magazine,"
concerning the Orffyrean Wheel:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Urban</span>: Being an admirer of improvements
in mechanics and desirous of seeing the
perpetual motion discovered, I was much pleased
on reading, some time ago, an account of the automaton
constructed by Orffyreus in two letters,
one from Professor 's Gravesande to Sir Isaac
Newton, the other from Baron Fischer to Dr.
Desaguliers, with the testimonial of the Landgrave
of Hesse-Cassel (who had seen the inside
of it) in favor of its construction. To which are
added some remarks by William Kenrick, the
writer of the pamphlet, who takes that opportunity
to propose a subscription for a similar machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
which he says he has contrived and denominated
a Rotator.</p>

<p>It is much to be lamented that the learned did
not examine more strictly into the merit of Orffyreus's
wheel; but, on the contrary, being prepossessed
with a notion of the impracticability of
the perpetual motion, suffered it to be neglected,
and at last destroyed by the hands of a disappointed
mechanic, who, with unwearied application
and steady perseverance, had brought it to
perfection. I wish we may not again let slip an
opportunity of becoming acquainted with an invention,
which, when made public, will reflect
honor on the inventor, and be of the utmost utility
to the world. Such, I would hope, is the rotator
mentioned by W. Kenrick; for, unless his discovery
were real, I cannot think that he would
have taken the liberty to express himself as he
does in p. 26, etc., "The inventor flatters himself
that, if the contents of the foregoing pages are
seriously attended to, and it be farther considered,
that not a penny of the proposed premium
is required, till the subscribers are fully satisfied
of the reality and utility of the invention, his proposal
will not be treated with so mortifying a
neglect as that of Orffyreus." Again he says,
"If it does not supply the place of a first mover,
at the expense only of the construction and repair
of a simple wheel subject to very little friction,
and that in all such engines and machines,
even from the slightest piece of clockwork to the
waterworks of Marli or London-bridge, he expects
nothing for his discovery, but to stand exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
to the contempt that will be justly thrown
on him for having so miserably misspent his time,
and frivolously engaged the attention of the
public."</p>

<p>Now, I think that W. Kenrick's proposals are
very fair; and should be glad to be informed,
whether any attention has been paid to them, and
whether Sir Isaac Newton took any notice of the
letter addressed to him by Professor Gravesande.
I shall consider it as a favor if any correspondent
will oblige me with an answer to these particulars.</p>

<p>In 1721 Rev. Dr. J. T. Desaguliers, LL.D.,
F.R.S., contributed to an English periodical entitled
"Philosophical Transactions," the following
article concerning the device of the Marquis of
Worcester, and the Orffyrean Wheel:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="smcap smaller center vspace">REMARKS ON SOME ATTEMPTS MADE TOWARDS A
PERPETUAL MOTION; BY THE REVEREND
DR. DESAGULIERS, F.R.S.</p>

<p>The wheel at Hesse-Cassel, made by Monsieur
Orffyreus, and by him called a perpetual
motion, has, of late, been so much talked of on
account of its wonderful phenomena, that a great
many people have believed it to be actually a self-moving
engine; and accordingly have attempted
to imitate it as such. Now, as a great deal of
time and money is spent in those endeavours, I
was willing (for the sake of those that try experiments
with that view) to show that the principle
which most of them go upon is false, and can
by no means produce a perpetual motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
They take it for granted that if a weight
descending in a wheel at a determined distance
from the center, does, in its ascent, approach
nearer to it; such a weight in its descent will always
preponderate and cause a weight equal to it
to rise, provided it comes nearer the center in its
rise; and accordingly as itself, rises, will be overbalanced
by another weight equal to it; and,
therefore, they endeavour by various contrivances
to produce that effect as if the consequence of it
would be a perpetual motion.</p>

<p>But I shall show that they mistake one particular
case of a general theorem, or rather a
corollary of it, for the theorem itself. The
theorem is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theor.</span>&mdash;If one weight in its descent does,
by means of any contrivance, cause another
weight to ascend with a less momentum or quantity
of motion than itself, it will preponderate and
raise the other weight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor. 1.</span>&mdash;Therefore, if the weights be equal,
the descending weight must have more velocity
than the ascending weight, because the momentum
is made up of the weight multiplied into the
quantity of matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cor. 2.</span>&mdash;Therefore, if a leaver or balance
have equal weights fastened or hanging at its
ends, and the brachia be ever so little unequal
that weight will preponderate which is farthest
from the center.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scholium.</span>&mdash;This second corollary causes
the mistake; because those who think the velocity
of the weight is the line it describes, expect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
that weight shall be overpoised, which describes
the shortest line, and, therefore, contrive machines
to cause the ascending weight to describe
a shorter line than the descending weight. As
for example, in the circle A D B <i>a</i> (Fig. 3) the
weights A and B being supposed equal, they imagine
that if (by any contrivance whatever)
whilst the weight A describes the arc A <i>a</i>, the
weight B is carried in any arc, as B <i>b</i>, so as to
come nearer the center in its rising than if it
went up the arc B D; the said weight shall be
overpoised, and consequently, by a number of
such weights a perpetual motion will be produced.</p>

<p>This is attempted by several contrivances,
which all depend upon this false principle; but I
shall only mention one which is represented by
Fig. 4, where a wheel having two parallel circumferences,
has the space between them divided into
cells, which being curved, will (when the wheel
goes round) cause weights placed loose in the said
cells to descend on the side A at the outer circumference
of the wheel, and on the side D to ascend
in the line B <i>b b b</i>, which comes nearer the center
and touches the inner circumference of the
wheel. In a machine of this kind the weights will
indeed move in such a manner if the wheel be
turned round, but will never be the cause of the
wheel's going round. Such a machine is mentioned
by the Marquis of Worcester in his "Century
of Inventions," in the following words, No.

<blockquote>

<p>"To provide and make that all the weights
of the descending side of a wheel shall be perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
farther from the center than those of the
mounting side, and yet equal in number and heft
to the one side as the other. A most incredible
thing, if not seen; but tried before the late King
(of blessed memory) in the Tower by my directions,
two extraordinary ambassadors accompanying
his Majesty, and the Duke of Richmond,
and Duke of Hamilton, with most of the court
attending him. The wheel was fourteen foot
over and had forty weights of fifty pounds a
piece. Sir William Balfore, then Lieutenant of
the Tower, can justify it with several others.
They all saw that no sooner these great weights
passed the diameter line of the lower side, but
they hung a foot farther from the center; nor no
sooner passed the diameter line of the upper side,
but they hung a foot nearer. Be pleased to judge
of the consequence."</p></blockquote>

<div id="if_i_225" class="figcenter" style="width: 219px;"><img src="images/i_225.jpg" width="219" height="187" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Now the consequence of this and such like
machines, is nothing less than a perpetual motion;
and the fallacy is this: The velocity of any weight
is not the line which it describes in general, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the height that it rises up to or falls from, with
respect to its distance from the center of the
earth. So that when the weight (Fig. 3) describes
the arc A <i>a</i>, its velocity is the line A C,
which shows the perpendicular descent (or measures
how much it is come nearer to the center of
the earth), and likewise the line B C denotes the
velocity of the weight B, or the height that it
rises to when it ascends in any of the arcs B <i>b</i>,
instead of the arc B D: so that in this case
whether the weight B in its ascent be brought
nearer the center or not, it loses no velocity which
it ought to do in order to be raised up by the
weight A. Nay, the weight in rising nearer the
center of a wheel may not only lose of its velocity,
but be made to gain velocity in proportion to the
velocity of its counterpoising weights that descend
in the circumference of the opposite side of
the wheel; for if we consider two radii of the
wheel, one of which is horizontal, and the other
(fastened to and moving with it) inclined under
the horizon in an angle of 60 degrees (Fig. 5)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and by the descent of the end B of the radius B C,
the radius C D by its motion causes the weight at
D to rise up the line <i>p</i> P, which is in a plane that
stops the said weight from rising in the curve
D A, that weight will gain velocity, and in the
beginning of its rise it will have twice the velocity
of the weight at B; and consequently, instead of
being raised, will overpoise, if it be equal to the
last mentioned weight. And this velocity will be
so much the greater in proportion as the angle
A C D is greater, or as the plane P <i>p</i> (along which
the weight D must rise) is nearer to the center.
Indeed, if the weight at B (Fig. 3) could, by any
means, be lifted up to β, and move in the arc β <i>b</i>,
the end would be answered; because then the
velocity would be diminished and become β C.</p>

<div id="if_i_226" class="figcenter" style="width: 183px;"><img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="183" height="163" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> (Fig. 5).&mdash;Take the leaver
B C D, whose brachia are equal in length, bent in
an angle of 120 degrees at C and moveable about
that point as its center: in this case a weight of
two pounds hanging at the end of B of the horizontal
part of the leaver will keep in equilibrio
a weight of four pounds hanging at the end D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
But if a weight of one pound be laid upon the end
D of the leaver, so that in the motion of D along
the arc <i>p</i> A, this weight is made to rise up against
the plane P <i>p</i> (which divides in half the line A C
equal to C B) the said weight will keep in equilibrio
two pounds at B, as having twice the velocity
of it when the leaver begins to move. This will
be evident, if you let the weight 4 hang at D,
whilst the weight 1 lies above it: for if then you
move the leaver the weight 1 will rise four times
as fast as the weight 4.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1770 Dr. William Kenrick published "A
Lecture on the Perpetual Motion." In it he has
the following to say concerning the alleged inventions
of the Marquis of Worcester, and Councillor
Orffyreus, and Perpetual Motion in general.
The following excerpts of and comments on the
lecture are taken verbatim from Dircks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The mere exhibition of a self-moving machine
without a display of its mechanism, or the
principles on which its motion is begun and continued,
could produce no conviction. The fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
of Orffyreus and his machine is a proof of this.
Scarce fifty years ago that whimsical mechanician
exhibited a perpetual motion at Hesse Cassel, the
constancy of whose operation was experienced
for many weeks under the most exact caution of
the Landgrave of that Principality, whose testimony
of such operation, as well as in favor of its
construction (to the secret of which he was admitted),
was given in the most explicit and determinate
form. And yet, because Orffyreus
could not display the mechanism without the previous
assurance of a premium of 200,000 florins
(near twenty thousand pounds), or because he
would not or could not discover the principles on
which it acted, his pretensions were neglected, his
machine was destroyed by his own hands, and his
life made a sacrifice to the chagrin attending his
disappointment. Twenty years had he racked his
brains for invention, and expended a patrimonial
competence with parsimony in prosecuting his
design. And when success inspired the hope of
reward, he found his ingenuity suspected of imposture,
and his industry rewarded with contempt.</p>

<p>Whether any of his successors in the same
pursuit will meet with a better fate is at length
to be determined. One species of our predecessor's
merit, however, I (adds Dr. Kenrick)
presume myself at least entitled to, that of perseverance;
it being now fifteen years since I
first engaged in this undertaking, which I have
since pursued with almost unremitted assiduity,
and that not only at a considerable waste of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
and expense, but under the constant mortification
of hearing it equally ridiculed by those who do
know, and by those who do not know, anything
of the matter.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, generally supposed, and as confidently
affirmed, that the mathematicians have
published demonstrations of the impossibility of a
perpetual motion. But I can safely take upon me
to affirm that no such demonstration was ever
published by any. Within these twelve years
past the mathematicians who deny the possibility
of a perpetual motion have been repeatedly and
publicly called upon, both in the foreign and English
prints, to produce a single instance of these
demonstrations. They have not done it. They
might have produced, indeed, the demonstrations
of Huygens, De la Hire, and others to prove, as
Desaguliers very properly expresses it the fallacy
of the schemes of most of the pretenders to the
perpetual motion. They proved nothing more;
and this was so far unnecessary in that the fallacy
evidently appeared in the discovery of the principle
on which they were founded.</p>

<p>This was done in the last century by the celebrated
Marquis of Worcester, in the presence of
the King and his Court, at the Tower, by the
exhibition of a wheel so contrived that in revolving
on its axis it carried up several weights nearer
its center on one side than they descended on the
other. The scheme was plausible and to appearance
practicable; but, though the wheel was polite
enough to turn about while his Majesty was present,
it could not be prevailed upon to be so complaisant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
in his absence. The mathematicians
avenged themselves of the short triumph of the
mistaken Marquis, but were equally mistaken
themselves in thinking they had routed the problem
or that in hunting down the jackal they had
destroyed the lion. The perpetual motion survived;
it had still its advocates; Professor Gravesande
and John Bernouille maintained its practicability,
the former giving his testimony in
favor of Orffyreus's machine, after a long and
scrutinous examination. It is not twelve years
since this testimony was republished by Dr. Allaman,
the present Professor of Natural Philosophy
at Leyden, whose own opinion, given at the same
time, is also greatly in favor of the discovery.
It is even some years later that a dissertation still
more in its favor, written, if I am not mistaken,
by the celebrated De Gorter of Petersburg, appeared
in the "Philosophical Transactions" of
Haarlem. My end is not to amuse or persuade,
but, with due deference, to inform and convince.
To remove every cause of objection, I must beg
leave to expatiate somewhat at large on the theory
of this discovery. It is with the more propriety
I presume on this method, as the discovery to
which I pretend has not been (as frequently happens)
the effect of mechanical accident, but the
premeditated result of mathematical reasoning
and physical experiment. I shall proceed to elucidate
the principal arguments <i>a priori</i>, that prove
the practicability of a perpetual motion to be the
necessary consequence of the known and established
laws of nature.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Having proceeded thus far, he opens his lecture
at page 7 with the introduction; and first
"On the Nature of Motion in General," which, in
fourteen pages, being more metaphysical than
mechanical, affords no extractable matter for our
present object. Part I is "On the Cause and
Effect of Motion." This elementary part is needlessly
labored and elaborated through 27 pages.
In the course of his remarks he states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The discovery of a perpetual motion, says
De la Hire, would be to discover a body at once
heavier and lighter than itself. But this is not a
fair state of the question. It is not necessary
that all the parts of a perpetually-moving machine
should be attached to, and inseparable from each
other; which they must be, to constitute one gravitating
body of a determinate weight.</p></blockquote>

<p>He proceeds to consider the nature of the
circulation of the blood, pneumatic pressure, the
steel-yard, real and relative weight, and spiral
action. Again, we have Hobbes, Locke, and
Stewart, in the same sentence with such language
as&mdash;"I could almost as readily impute ingenuity
to vegetables and fossils&mdash;to the sensitive plant
and the loadstone&mdash;as mediation to muscles, or
cogitabundity to cockles, periwinkles and rock
oysters!" In conclusions he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have endeavoured to make it appear that
motion is the mechanical effect of the physical
action of the primary elements; that the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
of motion only comes within the province of animal
intellect; that the vital system is supported
by mere mechanic motion, kept up by the elasticity
of the solids and the gravity of the fluids composing
the animal body; that by the same means
a more simple inanimate system or machine may
be framed which may have the same property of
continued action (or, as it is called, self-motion).
And this is all that is, or can be, expected of a
perpetual motion; the momentum of which may
be increased to any degree, according to the
weight of the bodies employed and the work required
to be done.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second part of this lecture commences
with a Proem of thirteen pages:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am induced (he says) to trespass farther
by extending in like manner the subsequent divisions
of it; making the second and third parts of
my printed syllabus the topics of the present reading,
and reserving the last part, with the concluding
experiment, to the third and final lecture.</p>

<p>I pretend merely to the investigation of the
general principles of mechanics, and even to illustrate
these so far only as I conceive they relate to
the immediate object of my lecture, the discovery
of an artificial perpetual motion; leaving the application
of such principles, in the solution of particular
phenomena, or the construction of particular
machines, to such as make the different arts
and sciences their peculiar study.</p></blockquote>

<p>He very prudently ends, observing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>But I beg pardon, gentlemen, for the length
of this digressive introduction, and shall proceed
to the more immediate subject of my lecture.</p></blockquote>

<p>Section 1 of this lecture is "On the Composition
and Combination of Motion." After discussing,
in his own peculiar style, mechanical
principles of motion, he adds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would require a volume, and that not a
small one, to illustrate these subjects and support
them by the necessary demonstrations and experiments.
Should Providence give me life and
health, therefore, they (his auditors) shall have
it. Indeed, I have already spent some years in
preparing such a volume for the press.</p></blockquote>

<p>He is very prolix on gravity and motion, then
commences Section 2 "On the Communication
and Dissipation of Motion." Five pages are
occupied in discussing motion, in popular language,
in the course of which he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And as to the imperfectly elastic bodies, their
power of retaining or communicating motion depends
entirely on their <i>vis inertiae</i> and weight;
nor can they on any occasion whatever communicate
a greater momentum to another body than
they themselves possess. It is sufficient for the
purpose of a perpetual motion that they can do
this. And, indeed, here all the difficulty lies, viz.,
in the means of communicating the momentum or
moving force of a heavy body to a light one.
Now, the most virulent opponents to the practicability
of perpetual motion have never pretended
to demonstrate the impracticability of this communication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
The <i>quomodo</i>, or means of effecting
it, being the point in dispute. It is to this
discovery that I pretend; and to show that my
pretensions are well grounded, have taken the
liberty to invite you to this lecture.</p></blockquote>

<p>The lectures appear to have been illustrated
by a plate having two figures of a simple apparatus
used to demonstrate the action of a spring
and two unequal weights; also an inflexible ruler
suspended between two unequal balls&mdash;with both
he experimented before his auditors; but the engraving
is wanting in the edition now used. In
conclusion, he observes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You see, gentlemen, I am purposely provided
here with a very simple and clumsy apparatus.
The perpetual motion does not need the assistance
of friction wheels, or depend on the niggling
nicety of tooth and pinion. If the practical part
of my discovery be not superior to the manual
dexterity of a village carpenter or country smith,
I am satisfied. There will be no great discernment
required to comprehend the design they are
to put in execution. You will permit me, however,
at present, to defer what I have farther to
offer on the subject to another opportunity.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1770 Dr. Kenrick published a quarto-pamphlet
concerning the Orffyrean Wheel, and in
the pamphlet appears the following regarding a
letter from Prof. Gravesande to Sir Isaac Newton,
and a letter from Baron Fischer to Dr.
Desaguliers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<h3 class="notbold"><i>A Letter from Professor 's Gravesande to Sir
Isaac Newton, Concerning Orffyreus's
Wheel</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Doctor Desaguliers has doubtless
shown you the letter that Baron Fischer wrote to
him some time ago about the wheel of Orffyreus;
which the inventor affirms to be a perpetual motion.
The landgrave, who is a lover of the
sciences and fine arts, and neglects no opportunity
to encourage the several discoveries and improvements
that are presented him, was desirous
of having this machine made known to the world,
for the sake of public utility. To this end he
engaged me to examine it; wishing that, if it
should be found to answer the pretensions of the
inventor, it might be made known to persons of
greater abilities, who might deduce from it those
services which are naturally to be expected from
so singular an invention. You will not be displeased,
I presume, with a circumstantial account
of this examination; I transmit you, therefore,
a detail of the most particular circumstances observable
on an exterior view of a machine, concerning
which the sentiments of most people are
greatly divided, while almost all the mathematicians
are against it. The majority maintain the
impossibility of a perpetual motion, and hence it
is that so little attention has been paid to Orffyreus
and his invention.</p>

<p>For my part, however, though I confess my
abilities inferior to those of many who have given
their demonstrations of this impossibility; yet I
will communicate to you the real sentiments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
which I entered on the examination of this machine.
It is now more than seven years since I
conceived I discovered the paralogism of those
demonstrations, in that, though true in themselves,
they were not applicable to all possible
machines; and have ever since remained perfectly
persuaded it might be demonstrated that a perpetual
motion involved no contradiction; it appearing
to me that Leibnitz was wrong in laying
down the impossibility of the perpetual motion as
an axiom. Notwithstanding this persuasion,
however, I was far from believing Orffyreus
capable of making such a discovery, looking upon
it as an invention not to be made (if ever) till
after many other previous discoveries. But since
I have examined the machine, it is impossible for
me to express my surprise.</p>

<p>The inventor has a turn for mechanics, but
is far from being a profound mathematician, and
yet his machine has something in it prodigiously
astonishing, even though it should be an imposition.
The following is a description of the external
parts of the machine, the inside of which
the inventor will not permit to be seen, lest any
one should rob him of his secret. It is a hollow
wheel, or kind of drum, about fourteen inches
thick and twelve feet diameter; being very light,
as it consists of several crosspieces of wood
framed together; the whole of which is covered
over with canvas, to prevent the inside from being
seen. Through the center of this wheel or drum
runs an axis of about six inches diameter, terminated
at both ends by iron axes of about three-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>quarters
of an inch diameter upon which the machine
turns. I have examined these axes and am
firmly persuaded that nothing from without the
wheel in the least contributes to its motion. When
I turned it but gently, it always stood still as soon
as I took away my hand; but when I gave it any
tolerable degree of velocity, I was always obliged
to stop it again by force; for when I let it go, it
acquired in two or three turns its greatest velocity,
after which it revolved for twenty-five or
twenty-six times in a minute. This motion it
preserved some time ago for two months, in an
apartment of the castle: the door and windows
of which were locked and sealed so that there was
no possibility of fraud. At the expiration of that
term indeed his serene highness ordered the
apartment to be opened, and the machine to be
stopped, lest, as it was only a model, the parts
might suffer by so much agitation. The landgrave
being himself present on my examination
of this machine, I took the liberty to ask him, as
he had seen the inside of it, whether after being
in motion for a certain time no alteration was
made in the component parts; or whether none of
those parts might be suspected of concealing some
fraud: on which his serene highness assured me
to the contrary, and that the machine was very
simple.</p>

<p>You see, sir, I have not had any absolute
demonstration, that the principle of motion which
is certainly within the wheel, is really a principle
of perpetual motion; but at the same time it cannot
be denied me that I have received very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
reasons to think so, which is a strong presumption
in favor of the inventor. The landgrave hath
made Orffyreus a very handsome present, to be
let into the secret of the machine, under an engagement
nevertheless not to discover, or to make
any use of it before the inventor may procure a
sufficient reward for making his discovery public.</p>

<p>I am very sensible, sir, that it is in England
only the arts and sciences are so generally cultivated
as to afford any prospect of the inventor's
acquiring a reward adequate to this discovery.
He requires nothing more than the assurance of
having it paid him in case his machine is found
to be really a perpetual motion; and as he desires
nothing more than this assurance till the construction
of the machine be displayed and fairly
examined before such assurance be given him.
Now, sir, as it would conduce to public utility as
well as to the advancement of science, to discover
the reality or the fraud of this invention, I conceive
the relation of the above circumstances
could not fail of being acceptable. I am, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same book appear the following animadversions
by Prof. Allaman, on the neglect of
Orffyreus's invention:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We see that the testimony of M. 's Gravesande
was as advantageous as possible to Orffyreus,
not having seen the interior of the machine,
he could form no other judgment; however, that
extraordinary man was not contented, for in consequence
of the examination Orffyreus broke the
machine into pieces. By the accounts of M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
's Gravesande, Baron Fischer and the testimony
of the Landgrave it appears clear that the wheel
was not moved by any exterior agent. Orffyreus
is, however, accused of being an impostor, of having
imposed on the good faith of the prince, deceived
M. 's Gravesande and all those who examined
his machine. His own servant deposed
against him and said that she was made to turn
the wheel, and thus he has fallen into contempt;
and everyone who protected him, is ashamed of
him. M. de Crousaz, who was at that time at the
court of Cassel, writes a letter to M. 's Gravesande
dated February 3, 1729, in these terms:&mdash;'First,
Orffyreus is a fool; Second, It is impossible that
a fool can have discovered what such a number
of clever people have searched for without success;
Third, I do not believe in impossibilities;
Fourth, One can easily imagine that persons keep
a secret from which they are to receive benefit,
but this fellow, hoping only to receive reputation,
allows it to be tarnished by an accusation which
he has in his power to disprove, if false; Fifth,
The servant who ran away from his house, for
fear of being strangled, has in her possession, in
writing, the terrible oath that Orffyreus made
her swear; Sixth, He only had to have asked, in
order to have had this girl imprisoned, until he
had time to finish his machine; Seventh, They
publish that the machine is going to be exhibited,
when suddenly those who advertise it become
silent; Eighth, It is true there is a machine at his
house, to which they give the name of perpetual
motion, but that cannot be removed; it is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
smaller, and differs from the first, inasmuch as
it only turns one way.</p>

<p>This is what makes Orffyreus and his machine
to be suspected; can it be that M. 's Gravesande
was so mistaken as to be his dupe? Let us
read what he himself says in answer to M.
Crousaz, which I have found among my papers,
without date:&mdash;"I have deferred replying to you
until I had found a paper which I wrote the day
after I examined Orffyreus' machine, for although
I remember well all that passed, I believe
that a paper, written the day after the examination,
and communicated to my Lord and all those
who were with him, must have more weight.</p>

<p>"This is what I heard; they say that a servant
under oath, turned Orffyreus' machine, being
placed in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>"I know well that Orffyreus is a fool, but I
ignore that he is an impostor; I have never decided
whether his machine is an imposture or not,
but this I know as certainly as anything in the
world, that if the servant says the above, she tells
a great falsehood.</p>

<p>"My Lord the Landgrave in the presence of
the Baron Fischer, Architect of the Emperor, and
other persons at my request, showed the supports
of the machine; we saw the axles uncovered; I
examined the plates or brasses on which the axles
rested and in that examination there did not appear
the slightest trace of communication with
the adjoining room. I remember very distinctly
the whole of the circumstances of that examination,
which put Orffyreus in such a rage with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
me, that the day after he broke his machine in
pieces, and wrote on the wall that, it was the impertinent
curiosity of Professor 's Gravesande
which was the cause. I read this myself the following
year, and the result of the examination is
clearly explained in the paper of which I spoke to
you.</p>

<p>"They told me several circumstances on the
testimony of the servant, but I pay little attention
to what a servant can say about machines,
perhaps in turning her master's roast-jack she
thought she saw a perpetual motion. If you know
anything concerning this matter I shall feel much
pleasure if you would communicate it."</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine what to believe
about this machine. It seems to me, however, that
on examining minutely the for and against Orffyreus
we can come to these conclusions: 1. That
Orffyreus was evidently mad, as M. 's Gravesande
and M. de Crousaz both affirm; his machinery
broken at different times without either
reason or necessity prove this. But his was a sort
of madness we do not often see: a folly fixed
only on certain objects, and merits more the name
of fantasticalness or whimsicalness; this kind of
folly is often accompanied by much genius, and
when persons of this disposition apply themselves
solely to one subject, as it appears he did, it is not
surprising to find them making discoveries which
had escaped the sagacity of wiser people. Thus
I do not wish to agree with M. de Crousaz, that
it is incredible that a madman, such as Orffyreus
should have found out something that learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
men have searched for unsuccessfully. Added
to this he is mistaken in saying that Orffyreus
could hope for no other reward for his secrets
than mere reputation: for he expected a considerable
profit seeing that he demanded for it 200,000
florins. 2. No exterior agent moved the machine;
if it were a servant that moved it, would it
not have been apparent to eyes so searching as
those that made the examination, or to the Landgrave,
who had seen the interior of the machine?
Besides how can any one imagine that a wheel of
so great a volume could have been moved by such
a cause, a cause which would act simply on the
axle in crossing the supports, and which must
have been so small as to have escaped the most
rigorous examination? 3. If the servant has not
been paid to depose against Orffyreus, what does
her testimony prove? Only that her master made
her believe that by turning a little wheel, she
moved the whole machine, and we can fancy a
singular character, such as he was might have
done this to prevent the curiosity of those who
sought to penetrate his secret; M. 's Gravesande's
opinion of this strange character is such that he
doubts not his whimsicalness prevented him from
making a new machine. 4. It must be confessed
that this wheel was a very remarkable mechanical
phenomenon, and this is all we can say, not knowing
more than the preceding details; it were too
much temerity to say that this invention was a
perpetual motion, as much as it would be wrong
to call it an imposture, seeing that no exterior
agent was employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Dr. Kenrick proceeds to state that:&mdash;The
celebrated John Bernoulli, speaking of the above
demonstration, in a letter to the author, remarks
that it is very just; the principle assumed necessarily
involving an augmentation of force, <i>viz.</i>,
a perpetual motion. But this, continues he, is no
more than Leibnitz had long before demonstrated
in his dispute with Papin and others.</p>

<p>Having thus occupied twenty-three pages in
fencing himself with a screen against the ridicule
he appears to have so much dreaded, and reasonably
anticipated from the many authors he had
himself similarly treated in the "London Review,"
we are informed that,&mdash;An accidental conversation,
many years ago, on the spot where
Orffyreus exhibited his machine, awakened the
author's curiosity and directed his attention to an
object which he has ever since occasionally pursued.
The experiments he has made, even so
long since as the year 1761, convinced him so far
of the reality of Orffyreus' discovery, that he applied
for letters-patent to secure an exclusive
right to the construction of a similar machine;
which he had contrived and denominated <span class="smcap">A
Rotator</span>. Before his patent, however, was expedited,
he reflected that, though the model he
had constructed might serve to remove the prejudices
of the public, it was not so well calculated
as it might be, to answer the practical purposes
of so important a discovery. To the improvement
of the Rotator, therefore, has he long since
dedicated all the time and attention he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
possibly spare from his other, more immediately
necessary, pursuits.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more flimsy than the statement
here made, and the next sentence would
seem to explain the true state of the case. He
proceeds: "Not that he believes he has contrived
quite so many different machines as Orffyreus
did, though he has been almost as many years
engaged in the like undertaking; he has, nevertheless,
both contrived and constructed a considerable
number, many of them useless as costly,
except indeed as they served to assist him in completing
his invention."</p>

<p>His invention, however, was <i>not</i> complete;
the very model of it was unsatisfactory. Like
Orffyreus, he had spent nearly twenty years,
making numerous, and some costly, machines.
He no doubt had his own misgivings, and wished
to reimburse himself for the great outlay he must
have incurred during that long period, before
the bubble finally burst! However, poor man,
he died nine years after publishing this elaborate
advertising prospectus, which concludes: "Such
bodies corporate, private companies or individuals,
as are interested in the construction or
use of considerable mechanical engines, or are
disposed to encourage the present discovery, may
receive any further information they require, on
applying to the inventor, <span class="smcap">William Kenrick</span>,
Charles street, St. James's Square, March 1,
1770."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1803, Dr. Charles Hutton, LL.D., and F. R. S.,
contributed in a brief work entitled, "Recreations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy,"
gave the following notice to the Orffyrean Wheel:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The perpetual motion has been the quicksand
of mechanicians, as the quadrature of the circle,
the trisection of an angle, etc., have been that of
geometricians: and as those who pretend to have
discovered the solution of the latter problems are
in general persons scarcely acquainted with the
principles of geometry, those who search for, or
imagine they have found, the perpetual motion,
are always men to whom the most certain and
invariable truths of mechanics are unknown.</p>

<p>It may be demonstrated, indeed, to all those
capable of reasoning in a sound manner on those
sciences, that a perpetual motion is impossible:
for, to be possible, it is necessary that the effect
should become alternately the cause, and the cause
the effect. It would be necessary, for example,
that a weight raised to a certain height by another
weight, should in its turn raise the second weight
to the height from which it descended. But, according
to the laws of motion, all that a descending
weight could do, in the most perfect machine
which the mind can conceive, is to raise another
in the same time to a height reciprocally proportional
to its mass. But it is impossible to construct
a machine in which there shall be neither
friction nor the resistance of some medium to be
overcome; consequently at each alternation of ascent
and descent, some quantity of motion, however
small, will always be lost: each time, therefore,
the weight to be raised will ascend to a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
height; and the motion will gradually slacken, and
at length cease entirely.</p>

<div id="if_i_246" class="figcenter" style="width: 205px;"><img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="205" height="229" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A moving principle has been sought for, but
without success, in the magnet, in the gravity of
the atmosphere, and in the elasticity of bodies. If
a magnet be disposed in such a manner as to facilitate
the ascension of a weight, it will afterwards
oppose its descent. Springs, after being unbent,
require to be bent by a new force equal to that
which they exercise; and the gravity of the atmosphere,
after forcing one side of the machine
to the lowest point, must be itself raised again,
like any other weight, in order to continue its
action.</p>

<p>We shall, however, give an account of various
attempts to obtain a perpetual motion, because
they may serve to show how much some
persons have suffered themselves to be deceived
on this subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<div id="if_i_247" class="figcenter" style="width: 216px;"><img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="216" height="237" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Fig. 52, plate 12, represents a large wheel,
the circumference of which is furnished, at equal
distances, with levers, each bearing at its extremity
a weight, and movable on a hinge, so that in
one direction they can rest upon the circumference,
while on the opposite side, being carried
away by the weight at the extremity, they are
obliged to arrange themselves in the direction of
the radius continued. This being supposed, it is
evident that when the wheel turns in the direction
<i>a b c</i>, the weights A B and C will recede from the
centre; consequently, as they act with more force,
they will carry the wheel towards that side; and
as a new lever will be thrown out, in proportion
as the wheel revolves, it thence follows, say they,
that the wheel will continue to move in the same
direction. But, notwithstanding the specious appearance
of this reasoning, experience has proved
that the machine will not go; and it may indeed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
demonstrated that there is a certain position in
which the centre of gravity of all these weights
is in the vertical plane passing through the point
of suspension, and that therefore it must stop.</p>

<p>The case is the same with the following machine,
which it would appear ought to move also
incessantly. In a cylindric drum, in perfect equilibrium
on its axis, are formed channels as seen in
Fig. 53, which contain balls of lead, or a certain
quantity of quicksilver. In consequence of this
disposition, the balls or quicksilver must, on the
one side, ascend by approaching the centre; and
on the other must roll towards the circumference.
The machine then ought to turn incessantly
towards that side.</p>

<p>A third machine of this kind is represented
in Fig. 54. It consists of a kind of wheel formed
of six or eight arms, proceeding from a centre,
where the axis of motion is placed. Each of these
arms is furnished with a receptacle in the form
of a pair of bellows, but those on the opposite
arms stand in contrary directions, as seen in the
figure. The movable top of each receptacle has
affixed to it a weight, which shuts it in one situation
and opens it in the other. In the last place,
the bellows of the opposite arms have a communication
by means of a canal, and one of them is
filled with quicksilver.</p>

<p>These things being supposed, it is visible,
that the bellows on the one side must open, and
those on the other must shut; consequently the
mercury will pass from the latter into the former,
while the contrary will be the case on the opposite
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
It might be difficult to point out the deficiency
of this reasoning; but those acquainted with the
true principles of mechanics will not hesitate to
bet a hundred to one that the machine, when constructed,
will not answer the intended purpose.</p>

<div id="if_i_249" class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;"><img src="images/i_249.jpg" width="328" height="349" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The description of a pretended perpetual motion,
in which bellows, to be alternately filled with
and emptied of quicksilver, were employed, may
be seen in the "Journal des Savans" for 1685. It
was refuted by Bernouilli and some others, and
it gave rise to a long dispute. The best method
which the inventor could have employed to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
his invention would have been to construct
it, and show it in motion; but this was never done.</p>

<p>We shall here add another curious anecdote
on this subject. One Orffyreus announced, at
Leipsic, in the year 1717, a perpetual motion, consisting
of a wheel which would continually revolve.
This machine was constructed for the
Landgrave of Hesse Cassel, who caused it to be
shut up in a place of safety, and the door to be
sealed with his own seal. At the end of forty
days, the door was opened, and the machine was
found in motion. This, however, affords no proof
in favor of a perpetual motion; for as clocks can
be made to go a year without being wound up,
Orffyreus's wheel might easily go forty days, and
even more.</p>

<p>The result of this pretended discovery is not
known. We are informed that an Englishman
offered 80,000 crowns for this machine; but
Orffyreus refused to sell it at that price: in this
he certainly acted wrong, as there is reason to
think he obtained by his invention, neither money,
nor even the honor of having discovered the perpetual
motion.</p>

<p>The Academy of Painting at Paris possessed
a clock which had no need of being wound up,
and which might be considered as a perpetual
motion, though it was not so. But this requires
some explanation. The ingenious author of this
clock employed the variations in the state of the
atmosphere for winding up his moving weight.
Various artifices might be devised for this purpose;
but this is no more a perpetual motion than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
if the flux and reflux of the sea were employed
to keep the machine continually going; for this
principle of motion is exterior to the machine,
and forms no part of it.</p>

<p>But enough has been said on this chimera of
mechanics. We sincerely hope that none of our
readers will ever lose themselves in the ridiculous
and unfortunate labyrinth of such a research.</p>

<p>To conclude, it is false that any reward has
been promised by the European Powers to the
person who shall discover the perpetual motion;
and the case is the same in regard to the quadrature
of the circle. It is this idea, no doubt, that
excites so many to attempt the solution of these
problems; and it is proper they should be undeceived.</p></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing, we believe, are sufficient to
disclose the gist of all that is known, and all that
has been said concerning the claimed inventions
of the distinguished Marquis and the distinguished
Councillor. It is manifest from reading
the above that Dircks himself, as well as nearly
all the other eminent persons quoted above, felt
an extreme delicacy in stating their honest belief
concerning the claims of the distinguished inventors.
That delicacy arose from their deference
to the rank and prominence of the Marquis
and the Councillor. The author of this book is
not thus encumbered, and has no such regard for
family or official rank, and feels at liberty to say
exactly what he thinks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
No one now actually believes that either the
Marquis or the Councillor ever made a wheel or
machine that actually furnished its own motive-power.
Those who believe in the impossibility of
Perpetual Motion, of course, do not admit the
possibility of such a thing. Those who may still
believe in the possibility of Perpetual Motion devices
admit, as they must, that had either of these
discoveries actually been made it would have
supplanted steam, electricity, wind, water and all
other forms of power for driving machinery, and,
indeed, for furnishing heat. And, yet, the above
articles and comments show that the contemporaries
of the Marquis and the Councillor, and subsequent
writers on their claims sought to find
excuses and explanations consistent with their
good faith and their claims. We do not accuse
either one of them of vicious falsehood, but the
truth is that when the Marquis of Worcester
wrote that "all the weights of the descending side
of a wheel shall be perpetually farther from the
centre than those of the mounting side, and yet
equal in number and heft to the one side as the
other. A most incredible thing, if not seen; but
tried before the late King (of blessed memory) in
the Tower by my directions," etc., he meant, if
he meant anything, to convey the idea that he had
constructed such a machine, and had exhibited it
before King Charles I, and when Orffyreus wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
"The inward structure of the wheel is of a nature
according to the laws of mechanical perpetual
motion, so arranged that by disposed weights
once in rotation they gain force from their own
swinging and must continue their movement as
long as their structure does not lose its position
and arrangement," he meant, as clearly appears
from the entire context of what he wrote, to convey
the idea that he had constructed a wheel
capable of moving perpetually by virtue of the
arrangement of its own parts until it should
wear out. Neither one spoke the truth. Each
knew that he had done no such thing as he claimed
to have done. He probably thought the solution
so near at hand that he could safely announce it
to the world, and when called upon for a demonstration
could produce the finished working
article.</p>

<p>The author of this book has known many
Perpetual Motion workers so confident and so
enthusiastic that unhampered with extreme discretion,
they announced that they were near
enough to the solution of this ages-old puzzle that
they were certain of success. A little less discretion,
with the slightest disregard or even carelessness
about the absolute truth could have easily
led them to announce that they had such a working
machine. The author has indeed known a few
such announcements. It is therefore, not surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
that in the history of Perpetual Motion labors,
instances can be found where the tireless, but enthusiastic
worker being full of confidence, and
not secretive, and with the least bit of human
carelessness about the truth have announced the
actual discovery and successful operation of the
machine. We will undertake to say that there
have been thousands of just such instances during
the last three or four centuries, probably tens of
thousands. It is probable that such an instance
could be found in every township in the United
States. It is not, therefore, surprising that two
instances can be found in persons of sufficient personal
eminence to give credence and weight to
their stories. Such we conceive the facts with
reference to the Marquis and the Councillor.
Each thought what he told when telling it to be a
harmless stretch of the truth, and felt sure that
he could protect himself by a very little added
perfection to his device. How many many Perpetual
Motion devices have been perfect and
ready for successful operation except for "one
little thing," which the inventor felt sure of finding.</p>

<p>The Marquis and Councillor by their little
indiscretion, and their puerile carelessness about
the truth, each made himself neither famous, nor
infamous, but ridiculous in history.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<span class="subhead">Conservation of Energy&mdash;A Discussion of the
Relation of the Doctrine of Conservation
of Energy, and the Possibility of
Perpetual Motion</span></h2>

<p><i>Conservation of Energy</i> is a doctrine to the
effect that energy, like matter, is indestructible,
and, except by the infinite, can neither be created
nor destroyed; that the sum total of all Energy
in the world remains constant; that it may manifest
itself in different forms, as heat, magnetism,
electricity, mechanical motion, vaporization, but
that the sum total remains the same.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more satisfactorily proved
than this doctrine, and, yet, like Newton's theory
of universal gravitation the proof does not
amount to a mathematical demonstration. Mathematics
demonstrates the conformity of the doctrine
of universal gravitation, and of Conservation
of Energy with all known natural processes
and observed phenomena; but mathematics does
not otherwise prove the Universality of Gravitation
nor Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>Writing on this subject of proof, with reference
to gravitation, the late and eminent Simon
Newcomb says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"It may be inquired, is the induction which
supposes gravitation universal so complete as to
be entirely beyond doubt? We reply that within
the solar system it certainly is. The laws of motion
as established by observation and experiment
at the surface of the earth must be considered as
mathematically certain. Now, it is an observed
fact that the planets in their motion deviate from
straight lines in a certain way. By the first law
of motion, such deviation can be produced only by
a force; and the direction and intensity of this
force admit of being calculated once that the motion
is determined. When thus calculated, it is
found to be exactly represented by one great force
constantly directed toward the sun, and smaller
subsidiary forces directed toward the several
planets. Therefore, no fact in nature is more
firmly established than is that of universal gravitation,
as laid down by Newton, at least within
the solar system."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will thus be observed that the theory of
Universal Gravitation is not by scientific men
claimed to have been mathematically demonstrated,
but its proof is regarded as resting upon
its conformity with known natural phenomena.
The same thing is true of Conservation of Energy.
Scientists and mathematicians do not claim
proof of this doctrine other than by its universal
coincidence with all natural manifestations, and,
yet its proof rests upon such a solid structure
of coincidence and conformity with all known
things in nature, that now all scientific research<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
begins with its assumption, and with the exclusion
of the possibility of Perpetual Motion.</p>

<p>It is not within the purview of this work to
give a history of the origin and establishment in
science of the doctrine. While, as heretofore
noted in this book, a number of scientists of the
past few centuries are shown by their reflections
to have had a measure of appreciation of its ultimate
effect, and to have applied that effect in their
scientific researches, there is no evidence that they
ever dreamed of its establishment as a basic fact
of science. The real establishment and acceptance
of the doctrine dates not much over a half
century back. Since that time many scientists
have in their researches and writings contributed
to its evolution and formation. The experiments
of Joule, of England, and the generalizations of
Helmholtz, of Germany, are entitled to special
mention.</p>

<p>Scientists are naturally and necessarily conservative.
So many startling pseudo-scientific
facts are announced, that every startling scientific
theory, before it is accepted, is submitted to the
most careful and crucial tests. No modern scientist
will announce a scientific fact as having been
demonstrated until the demonstration is complete
and fortified with repeated tests of mathematical
rigidity, and as long as there remains a phenomenon
that does not conform to the supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
theory, acceptance and promulgation will be withheld.
It is, therefore, not surprising that the
doctrine of Conservation of Energy has been
thoroughly intrenched as an established indisputable
and accepted fact of science, less than a
single generation.</p>

<p>The student of natural science should be
warned against the common error of supposing
that the discovery of a scientific fact or theory,
means demolition of the old theories. The rule
is the other way. New theories are additional
information to the world, and usually conform
to, and are built upon what was known before.
Conservation of Energy was generalized from
previously known facts conformed to them and
reflexively elucidated them, and left them standing
clearer than before.</p>

<p>The proof that Conservation of Energy conforms
to all other known phenomena of nature
has been aided, and hastened by the refinement of
scientific instruments by which forms of energy
such as heat, electricity, and magnetism can be
more delicately measured and determined than
ever before, and if instruments for measuring
and determining the amount of energy in its various
forms were as crude as they were even a
single century ago, it is probable Conservation
of Energy would still be the undiscovered foundation
of all natural phenomena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Let us now consider a few well-known facts
which it has been determined positively by the
most delicate instruments, prove and illustrate
the doctrine of Conservation of Energy.</p>

<p>Resistance to motion, or which is the same
thing, motion against resistance, is always accompanied
by heat. This developed heat is not
always readily perceptible to our sense of touch.
A stone, ball or other object thrown through the
air has its motion gradually arrested by the air.
Heat is developed, but the heat is distributed
through so much air and the object thrown is
heated so little that this development of heat was
not known until scientifically discovered. Where
the resistance is friction, the development of heat
is quite perceptible, and has always been well
known. Suppose a coin be rubbed on a cloth or
blotter. Heat is developed both in the coin and
the blotter&mdash;the more vigorous the rubbing&mdash;i. e.,
the more energy expended, the greater the heat.
Science has determined that the developed heat
is exactly proportional to the expended energy.
Every machinist knows that in turning a tap on
a bolt where the threads are rusty so that it
turns only with the application of great force, a
considerable amount of heat is readily developed.
The heat developed is proportional to the energy
expended in turning the tap.</p>

<p>A wheel revolving on a spindle will develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
heat exactly proportional to the resistance the
spindle offers to the wheel turning upon it. Thus,
we often see smoke and a blaze rising from the
spindles of the car wheels where oil is lacking,
and they turn with difficulty.</p>

<p>Every farmer knows that if a buggy wheel
turns with difficulty for want of lubrication, or
for any other reason, the spindle will heat, expand
and lock the wheel, so that it will often either
grind out the boxing or slide on the ground.
Whereas, if the parts be kept lubricated so that
less energy is required to turn the wheel on the
spindle, there is no perceptible heat developed,
but in all cases heat is developed to some extent,
and the heat developed is exactly proportional to
the energy necessary to force the revolution.</p>

<p>With heat we can boil water and make steam
under a pressure, and with the steam under a
pressure we can run an engine, and with the engine
make heat by friction, or make electric current
that can produce heat. Carry this proposition
back to the fuel box, and knowing the
amount of heat developed by the burning of a
certain quantity of fuel, it is found that, counting
the heat that rises in the air through the smoke
stack, the heat that is radiated from the boiler,
the heat that is carried away in warmed ashes,
the heat that exists in the steam after it is exhausted
from the cylinder, and all other heat expended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
whether utilized in driving the machinery
or going to waste, the sum total is in every case
equal to the heat developed by the fuel box combustion.
The most striking thing about all this
is that when the steam goes into the cylinder
where it is cooled as it expands and drives the
pistons, the heat <i>thus lost by the expanding steam
is the exact equivalent of the mechanical energy
realized against the piston head</i>. Not all of the
energy that is realized at the piston head is delivered
to the driving shaft. Some of it is lost in
the friction of the piston rings wearing against
the cylinder lining; some, of course, is lost in
friction at the journals connecting with the driving
shaft. It is usual in counting engine efficiency
to count the amount of energy delivered to the
belt, or to the driving shaft, and because of the
frictional resistance of the pistons working in the
cylinder, there is always found a little discrepancy
between the energy represented by the cooling
of the steam in the cylinder and the energy delivered
to the belt, or the driving shaft.</p>

<p>It is quite surprising how much energy a
small amount of heat represents if it could all be
converted into the obvious forms of energy.
Owing to the great waste suffered in all modern
machinery, heat represents much more energy
than is ordinarily supposed, in the absence of exact
knowledge. One would hardly think it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
that the amount of heat that will raise the
temperature of one pound (almost exactly one
pint) of water, one single degree (Fahrenheit) is
the equivalent of energy required to elevate one
pound seven hundred seventy-eight feet high
against the force of gravity. Yet, such is the
case. This was one of the demonstrations of the
immortal Joule. It was he who enabled us to
cross the bridge with calculations from mechanical
force and motion to heat. He stated the
equivalent to be seven hundred seventy-two feet,
but more delicate instruments than could be had
in his day have shown a slight discrepancy in his
calculations, and it is now known to be almost
exactly seven hundred seventy-eight feet. Thus,
if the Falls of Niagara be considered as being one
hundred sixty feet high, the energy developed by
the descent is only the equivalent of the heat necessary
to raise the temperature of the water about
one-fifth of one degree. A modern railroad locomotive
does well to realize to the driving rod two
per cent of the total energy developed in the fuel
box. An ordinary thrasher engine realizes no
more than one per cent. The very best steam engines
known in large stationary plants do not
realize as much as fifteen per cent.</p>

<p>The amount of heat necessary to raise the
temperature of one pound of water one degree is
taken as a standard for heat measurement, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
known as a British Thermal Unit&mdash;nearly always
in scientific works abbreviated to B. T. U. The
common standard of energy is the amount of energy
or work necessary to elevate one pound one
foot against the force of gravity. This in scientific
works is usually referred to as the foot-pound.</p>

<p>From what is said above it is manifest that
one B. T. U. is the equivalent of seven hundred
seventy-eight foot-pounds, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The <i>amount</i> of energy must not be confused
with the <i>rate</i> of expending energy, or doing work.
The horse-power is the common measurement of
the rate of delivery of energy or of doing work
and is equivalent to 33,000 foot-pounds per
minute. It is what one horse can do, and continue
doing several hours with reasonable ease.
For a short time a horse can exert several horse-power.</p>

<p>Remember, and remember always that heat
and electricity are just as much forms of energy
as the motion of concrete objects.</p>

<p>We have introduced the above statement of
equivalents for the purpose of enabling us to present
a few fundamental facts more clearly than
could otherwise be done.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that if paddles be revolved
rapidly in a vessel containing a liquid, such as a
churn, or the like, the liquid will offer considerable
resistance to their motion, the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
resistance depending upon the nature of the
liquid, and the rapidity of the motion.</p>

<p>Our scientific instruments have determined
the fact to be that the B. T. U. developed in the
liquid and on the paddles is the exact equivalent
to the foot-pounds of energy required to drive the
paddles, i. e., the number of B. T. U. is 778 times
the number of foot-pounds.</p>

<p>An engine is run with steam&mdash;the engine
drives an electric generator. Electricity is developed.
This electricity is conducted over a wire
to a motor. It is always found that not as much
energy can be derived from the motor as is supplied
from the generator to the wire. Where is
the loss?</p>

<p>It is found that the loss is in the resistance
of the wire to the current, and that the wire is
warmed&mdash;possibly not sufficient to be perceptible
to the ordinary sense of touch, and, yet, it is
warmed to some extent, and the B. T. U., developed
in, and radiated away by the wire, amounts
precisely and exactly to the difference in foot-pounds
between the energy supplied to the wire at
one end of the wire, and the energy supplied by
the wire at its other end.</p>

<p>Capillary Attraction is one form of motion
by which liquids are elevated and carried considerable
distance. The moisture is taken from
the earth and carried up the trunks of trees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
out through their limbs to their leaves. This cannot
be done without force and energy, but where
is the heat? It has been determined and proven
that there is an expenditure of heat in doing that
work, and that the expenditure of heat is precisely
equivalent to the work done. It is hardly believable
that there is a loss of heat by coal oil or
water, or other liquid performing the work of
ascending the wick, and yet, science has determined
that that work is only done at the expense
of that other form of energy&mdash;heat.</p>

<p>If an object falls a distance of twenty feet,
and it strikes one end of a lever having two arms
of equal length, and at the other end of the lever
there be a ball of equal weight, the other ball will
be thrown upward twenty feet, less an allowance
for the resistance of the air in the descent and
ascent, and for the frictional resistance of the
motion of the lever. It would throw a ball of
twice the weight half the height by adjusting the
levers properly. Or, it would throw a ball of
one-third the weight three times as high, and
so on.</p>

<p>A ball rolling down an inclined plane is found
to have a velocity, and consequently a striking
force, and an energy equal to that acquired in
falling the vertical distance of its descent, due
allowance being made for the resistance offered
to its rolling motion. It makes no difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
whether the incline be great or small, the velocity,
the energy are the same as though it had fallen
perpendicularly through the same vertical distance.</p>

<p>Instances and illustrations can be multiplied
indefinitely. Millions of tests have been made
by scientific men, and the basic fact of Conservation
of Energy is found true everywhere. That
fact is that energy cannot be created. So much
as is given is returned in some other form, or else
in the form of heat, but in some form, precisely
the equivalent is always found to exist.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful experiments is
with the pendulum. Imagine a nail or peg driven
into a wall and projecting out&mdash;say six inches
from the wall. Hang a pendulum four feet long&mdash;let
the pendulum swing parallel to the wall in
the annexed figure. Let "A" represent the
point from which the pendulum is suspended.
Draw the pendulum back to C, and release
it. Its lowest descent in the swing will be
at B. It will swing to D, and a line connecting
D &amp; C is exactly horizontal, showing that the
energy represented by the motion of the pendulum
at B was sufficient to elevate it to the point
D. Now, on a line on the wall downward
from where the nail or peg is driven into the
wall, let there be made holes into which a nail or
peg can be inserted, and suppose a peg be driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
at the point F. If now pendulum be released at
C, it will be found that when the cord strikes F
the pendulum will swing to the point J, which is
on the horizontal line D C. It makes no difference
where the interrupting peg or nail be placed,
the pendulum will rise to the same horizontal
from which it was released. It is said that this
was one of Gallileo's experiments. If so, it is another
example of the masterly force and originality
of his genius, and shows that he subconsciously
had some appreciation of the basic facts of the
now accepted doctrine of Conservation of Energy.</p>

<div id="if_i_267" class="figcenter" style="width: 192px;"><img src="images/i_267.jpg" width="192" height="177" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>We believe it is useless to multiply instances
further, to illustrate the doctrine of Conservation
of Energy, and show the character of proof upon
which it rests. There is no fact in nature, but
what in the hands of modern science appears to
conform to this doctrine. A few years ago when
radio-active properties were first discovered it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
was thought that it was an exception, but even
that has been found to conform to this wonderful
generalized doctrine.</p>

<p>If the doctrine of Conservation of Energy
be true about which there seems to be no doubt,
then all hopes of ever attaining Perpetual Motion
must cease, for the idea of Perpetual Motion is
predicated and has its foundation upon the creation
of energy. The mechanism must give more
energy than is imparted to it. It must make
energy, and this in the light of the generalized
truth of Conservation of Energy is an impossibility.
We might as well talk about making substance,
and the creation of substance, or the creation
of energy either one is not an attribute of
man. It is an attribute to be accredited only to
the infinite, and can not be conceived as an attribute
of the finite.</p>

<span class="subhead">Will Perpetual Motion Ever Be Accomplished?</span></h2>

<p>The antiquity of the problem of Perpetual
Motion, and the countless attempts by clever and
ingenious minds to accomplish its solution, and
the uniform failure of such attempts is no proof
at all, scientifically speaking, that Perpetual Motion
is an impossibility. If there be scientific
proof that Perpetual Motion is unattainable, that
proof must be found elsewhere than in the number
of attempts and the universality of failures,
or in the number or eminence of the people who
believe it to be impossible.</p>

<p>Dircks in his work printed in 1861, being
"A History of the Search for Self-Motive Power,
During the 17th 18th and 19th Centuries," says
on the subject:</p>

<p>"The subject of Perpetual Motion opposes
paradox to paradox. It is viewed both as being
most simple and most difficult to find. The learned
justify both its possibility and impossibility.
Many mechanics believe it possible * * *
Its pursuit always commences in confidence, only
to end in doubt. * * *</p>

<p>We think a careful perusal of all that has
been gathered respecting Perpetual Motion clearly
establishes that much remains to be done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
prove the impossibility of practically solving this
knotty problem; and that a full demonstration of
the difficulties that environ it is worthy of being
attempted, even by the most exalted mathematicians.
It is not requisite that they should
descend to the level of the most ordinary minds,
but leave it for others to reduce their elaborated
reasonings on the subject to some generally comprehensible
form. We fear the proposal partakes
too much of the difficulty of proving a negative;
but still, as the attempt has been made by celebrated
savants, and is generally considered insufficient;
and as data may have been wanting, which
we conceive a collection of the chief known examples
will supply; we recommend the consideration
of this matter to all geometers. * * *</p>

<p>In a mathematical point of view, we think
this subject is far from being exhausted; and,
after what has been advanced, may very properly
be considered as claiming grave considerations.
And that, scientifically examined, it is a mark of
mere shallowness and querulousness to attempt
the substitution of ridicule and satire for the
more difficult, but consistent course of sound,
close reason and argument, such as the wonted
sobriety and severity of scientific criticism accords
to its investigations generally."</p>

<p>At the time of the publication of Dircks's
work from which the above quotation is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
(1861), the doctrine of Conservation of Energy
had not been announced and accepted as an established
generalization of a scientific fact, and
it is apparent was not understood by him.
Dircks's statement "as data may have been wanting,
which we conceive a collection of the chief
known examples will supply," shows that he misconceived
the nature of the problem of proving
the impossibility of Perpetual Motion. If, however,
the principle of Conservation of Energy is
a true scientific fact, the impossibility of self-motive
power follows as an inevitable scientific
corollary, and the ignis fatuus hope of attaining
Perpetual Motion which has deluded so many
bright minds is forever destroyed and demolished.</p>

<p>A perusal of the arguments against Perpetual
Motion made by thinking men with scientific
minds even though long before the thorough
establishment of the doctrine of transmutation
and Conservation of Energy, discloses the fact
that those arguments in fact depend finally on
the principle now known and designated Conservation
of Energy.</p>

<p>It is amusing to note in reading the arguments
on the subject by our greatest philosophers,
Newton, Gallileo, Huyghens, and Descartes, that
while they lived and labored long before Conservation
of Energy in its generalized form was
known, or announced, they seemed to have a perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
that energy could not be created; that
energy must produce an effect commensurate
with its own activity; that the existence of energy
in one body is proof positive that some agency
furnished and lost an exact equivalent of that
energy. In other words, these men in reasoning
on specific problems presented to them, and on
the problem of Perpetual Motion in particular,
appear to have appreciated and applied in their
reasonings, the principle of Conservation of
Energy.</p>

<p>Men who have worked at the problem of
Perpetual Motion before the establishment of the
doctrine of Conservation of Energy, and men
who still work at the problem, who, through lack
of opportunity have not become familiar with
that doctrine, are not to be blamed or thought
stupid because of that folly, but those who knowing
that principle, or being in a situation to know
it, must be mechanically and mathematically
stupid not to realize that Perpetual Motion and
Conservation of Energy are irreconcilable, and
that both cannot be possibilities. In this day when
the principle of Conservation of Energy is taught
in the High Schools of the United States, and in
every other civilized country in the world, it is
not surprising that fewer people work on Perpetual
Motion than formerly, and that public interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
in the subject is waning, as waning it
surely is.</p>

<p>A generation ago, however, this principle
was not known and taught, and the state of the
world's learning was at such a stage that many
even scientific minds thought Perpetual Motion
possible, and worked for its attainment.</p>

<p>The principle of Conservation of Energy as
applied to all Perpetual Motion devices can be
stated as follows: There can be no mechanical
effect without an equal mechanical cause. Energy&mdash;i. e.,
the capacity to do work, can only be imparted
by an equal amount of work done. It
therefore follows axiomatically that Perpetual
Motion is possible only if and when a machine be
produced that runs absolutely without friction
and absolutely without atmospheric resistance,
or the resistance of bending of cords, or other like
mechanical resistance. If there be such resistance,
then the energy imparted to the machine
will be diminished by that resistance, with the result
that the machine can only yield the amount of
energy imparted, less the energy required to
overcome such resistance. That no machine can
be built free of such resistance is patent to even
a tyro in mechanics.</p>

<p>It will be interesting here, and perhaps more
interesting than useful, to add some of the arguments
quoted by Dircks and reproduced in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
work for and against the possibility of Perpetual
Motion. They have little scientific value at this
time, as they were all made by men who were
unfamiliar with the decisive principle of Conservation
of Energy. Nevertheless, for their historical
interest we offer a few:</p>

<h3 class="vspace">The Possibility of Perpetual Motion Denied<br />
Remarks of Dr. Papin on a French Contrivance</h3>

<p>In 1665, Dr. Papin, Fellow of the Royal Society,
brought before the Royal Society of London,
a paper concerning a French contrivance for
Perpetual Motion. The following excerpt will
illustrate and explain the contrivance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The paper printed in French, and containing
contrivance for perpetual motion, being set down
in such a manner that can hardly be understood
but by those that are much acquainted with such
descriptions, I have endeavored to explain it as
follows:</p>

<p>Let D E F be a pair of bellows forty inches
long, that may be opened by removing the part F
from E; let them be exactly shut everywhere but
at the aperture E; and let a pipe E G, twenty or
twenty-two inches long, be soldered to the said
aperture E, having its other end in a vessel G,
full of mercury, and placed near the middle of
the bellows.</p>

<p>A is an axis for the bellows to turn upon.</p>

<p>B, a counterpoise fastened to the lower end
of the bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<div id="if_i_275" class="figleft" style="width: 101px;"><img src="images/i_275.jpg" width="101" height="297" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>C, a weight with a clasp
to keep the bellows upright.</p>

<p>Now, if we suppose the
bellows opened only to one-third
or one-fourth, standing
upright, and full of mercury, it
is plain that the said mercury,
being forty inches high, must
fall, as in the Torricellian experiment,
to the height of
about twenty-seven inches,
and, consequently, the bellows
must open towards F, and
leave a vacuity there. This
vacuity must be filled with the
mercury ascending from G
through the pipe G E, the said
pipe being but twenty-two
inches long; by this means the
bellows must be opened more and more, till the
mercury continuing to ascend makes the upper
part of the bellows so heavy that the lower part
must get loose from the clasp C, and the bellows
should turn quite upside down; but the vessel G
being set in a convenient place, keeps them horizontal,
and the part F engageth there in another
clasp C; then the mercury, by its weight, runs out
from the bellows into the vessel G through the
pipe E G, and the bellows must shut closer and
closer until the part E F comes to be so light that
the counterpoise B is able to make the part F get
loose from the clasp C; then the bellows come to
be upright again; the mercury left in them falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
again to the height of twenty-seven inches, and,
consequently, all the other effects will follow as
we have already seen, and the motion will continue
forever. Thus much for the French author.</p>

<div id="if_i_276" class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;"><img src="images/i_276.jpg" width="374" height="130" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Upon this it is to be observed, that the bellows
can never be opened by the internal pressure,
unless the said pressure be stronger then the external;
now, in this case, the weight of the atmosphere
doth freely press up the outward part of
the bellows, but it cannot come at the inward part
but through the pipe G E, which, containing
twenty-two perpendicular inches of mercury, does
counterpoise so much of the weight of the atmosphere,
so that this being supposed to be twenty-seven
inches of mercury, it cannot press the inward
part of the bellows but with weight
equivalent to five perpendicular inches of mercury.
From this we may conclude, that the pressure
of the atmosphere, being weakened within
the bellows more then it can be helped by the
mercury contained in the same, as may easily be
computed, the said bellows standing upright must
rather shut then open. Thus, without losing any
labor and charges in trying, people may be sure
that the thing can never do.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Two "Certain" Plans for (Not) Producing Perpetual
Motion</h3>

<p>In 1834, the following article was contributed
to "Mechanics' Magazine." The contributor was
very frank, and presents some splendid suggestions
for Perpetual Motion workers. His article
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Very few young mechanicians escape being
seduced into an attempt to produce a perpetual
movement, by making gravitation counteract itself.
They are not contented with being told by
older men, that a cause can never be made to exceed
its own power; yet gravitation is expected by
them to lift up on one side more weight than sinks
on the other, with some percentage of friction
into the bargain. Nature, however, is too true
to itself to be so taken in by all or any of the
multitudes of various ways the inventive genius
of man has contrived, and still keeps contriving,
to circumvent her immutable laws, with no other
effect than to render the case so complicated as to
puzzle the judgment of the inventors, which ends
usually in their firm belief that they have outwitted
nature instead of themselves. I acknowledge
that in my youth I was one of this class, and,
for the benefit of the young, I beg to present you
with two <i>certain</i> plans for producing perpetual
motion, and compelling gravity to be frolicsome,
and do more work than she ought.</p>

<p>Let A (Fig. 1) be a cistern full of oil or
water, above 4 feet deep. Let B be a wheel; freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
suspended within it, on its axle, let there be four
wide glass tubes, 40 inches long, <i>c c c c</i>, having
large bulbs, holding, say a pint, blown at the
closed end. Fill these tubes with mercury, fix on
an Indian-rubber ball or bladder, that will hold a
pint, to each of them at the open end, and let them
be attached round the wheel, as exhibited in the
figure. As the pressure of 40 inches of mercury
will exceed the atmospheric pressure, and also
that of the four-foot column of water, when the
Indian-rubber bottle is lowest, and the tube erect,
at D, the mercury will fill it, leaving a vacuum
in the glass bulb above. On the opposite side the
mercury will fill the glass bulb, and the Indian-rubber
bottle will be pressed flat, as will also be
the case in the two horizontal tubes. Now, it is
evident that the two horizontal tubes exactly balance
each other; but the tube D, with its bulb
swelled out, displaces a pint of water more than
its opposite tube, and hence will attempt to rise
with the force of about one pound; and each tube,
when it arrives at the same position, must produce
the same result, the wheel must have a continual
power, equal to about one pound, with a radius of
two feet.&mdash;Q. E. D.</p>

<p>Let Fig. 2 represent a light drum of wood&mdash;one-half
of which is inserted into a cleft in a
water-cistern A, which fits it, and from which the
water is prevented from escaping by a strip of
leather, which the water presses against the drum,
and which thus operates as a valve, without much
friction (especially if oil be substituted for water
in the cistern). Now, as this drum is much lighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
than water, it must ever attempt to swim, and
thus, in perpetually rising, cause the drum to
revolve forcibly round its axle.&mdash;Q. E. D.</p>

<div id="if_i_279" class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;"><img src="images/i_279.jpg" width="392" height="246" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>I tried this last method thirty years ago, but
it was so obstinate as not to move one inch at my
bidding, though it obviously is proved, to demonstration,
that it ought to have gone on swimmingly.
I have just heard that an Italian gentleman
has hit upon the same plan; so it seems that
the mania is not confined to England.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article above quoted elicited a varied
correspondence on the subject of self-motive
power. The editor finally made the following apt
and happy remark concerning the two "Certain"
plans:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>We think our correspondent, S. F., has entirely
misconceived the scope of the playful account,
given in our last number, of two plans of
perpetual motion. The object of the writer seems
to have been, to impress on the minds of young
mechanicians the folly of wasting their time in
vain endeavors to render the effects of causes
greater than the causes themselves; or, in other
words, to gain power out of nothing&mdash;a process
without limit or value, were it not cut short by
the want of all limit to its folly; and this he could
not, perhaps, have done in any way so well, as by
exhibiting a couple of infallible perpetual movers
that would not stir at all, though they bade as fair
for it as any of their kindred.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Article by Rev. John Wilkins</h3>

<p>Rev. John Wilkins of England, born 1614;
died 1672, published a work called "Mathematical
Magic," in which he discoursed scientifically and
technically on efforts that had been made up to
that time to attain Perpetual Motion. His work
shows great scholarship, diligent search, and a
thorough knowledge of mathematics and mechanics.
Considering the state of scientific knowledge
at the time when he lived and worked, his
insight into scientific subjects is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>Considering the state of scientific learning
in his day, his observations on the subject of Perpetual
Motion show him to have possessed really
a great scientific and analytical mind. Of all
those who wrote or thought extensively on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
subject in that century we regard what he had to
say as being the most worthy of reproduction.
The following excerpt from "Mathematical
Magic," will give the reader an idea of his course
of reasoning and conclusions on the subject of
self-motive power:</p>

<blockquote>

<h4 class="hang">CHAP. IX.&mdash;<i>Of a Perpetual Motion&mdash;The
seeming facility and real difficulty of any
such contrivance&mdash;The several ways whereby
it hath been attempted, particularly by
Chemistry.</i></h4>

<p>It is the chief inconvenience of all the automata
before-mentioned, that they need a frequent
repair of new strength, the causes whence
their motion does proceed being subject to fail,
and come to a period; and, therefore, it would be
worth our enquiry to examine whether or no
there may be made any such artificial contrivance,
which might have the principle of moving from
itself so that the present motion should constantly
be the cause of that which succeeds.</p>

<p>This is that great secret in art which, like the
Philosopher's Stone in Nature, has been the business
and study of many more refined wits for
divers ages together; and it may well be questioned
whether either of them as yet have ever
been found out; though if this have, yet like the
other, it is not plainly treated of by any author.</p>

<p>Not but there are sundry discourses concerning
this subject, but they are rather <i>conjectures</i>
than <i>experiments</i>. And though many inventions
in this kind may at first view bear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
great show of probability, yet they will fail, being
brought to trial, and will not answer in practice
what they promised in speculation. Any one who
has been versed in these experiments must needs
acknowledge that he has been often deceived in
his strongest confidence; when the imagination
has contrived the whole frame of such an instrument,
and conceives that the event must infallibly
answer its hopes, yet then does it strangely deceive
in the proof and discovers to us some defect
which we did not before take notice of.</p>

<p>Hence it is that you shall scarce talk with
any one who has never so little smattering in
these arts, but he will instantly promise such a
motion as being but an easy achievement, till
further trial and experience has taught him the
difficulty of it. There being no enquiry that does
more entice with the <i>probability</i> and deceive with
the <i>subtilty</i>.</p>

<p>I shall briefly recite the several ways whereby
this has been attempted, or seems most likely to
be effected, thereby to contract and facilitate the
enquiries of those who are addicted to these kind
of experiments; for when they know the defects
of other inventions, they may the more easily
avoid the same or the like in their own.</p>

<p>The ways whereby this has been attempted
may be generally reduced to these three kinds:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>1. By Chemical Extractions.</li>
<li>2. By Magnetical Virtues.</li>
<li>3. By the Natural Affection of Gravity.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>

<p>1. The discovery of this has been attempted
by chemistry. Paracelsus and his followers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
bragged that by their separations and extractions
they can make a little world which shall have the
same perpetual motions with this microcosm, with
the representation of all meteors, thunder, snow,
rain, the courses of the sea in its ebbs and flows,
and the like. But these miraculous promises
would require as great a faith to believe them as
a power to perform them; and though they often
talk of such great matters:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At nusquam totos inter qui talia curant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Apparet ullus, qui re miracula tanta<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comprobet&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">yet we can never see them confirmed by any real
experiment; and then, besides, every particular
author in that art has such a distinct language of
his own (all of them being so full of allegories
and affected obscurities), that 'tis very hard for
any one (unless he be thoroughly versed amongst
them) to find out what they mean, much more
to try it.</p>

<p id="alchsmys">One of these ways (as I find it set down) is
this: Mix five ounces of ☿ with an equal weight
of ♃; grind them together with ten ounces of
sublimate; dissolve them in a cellar upon some
marble for the space of four days, till they become
like oil olive; distil this with fire of chaff, or driving
fire, and it will sublime into a dry substance;
and so, by repeating of these dissolvings and distillings,
there will be at length produced divers
small atoms, which, being put into a glass well
luted and kept dry, will have a perpetual motion.</p>

<p>I cannot say anything from experience
against this; but I think it does not seem very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
probable, because things that are forced up to
such vigorousness and activity as these ingredients
seem to be by their frequent sublimings
and distillings, are not likely to be of any duration.
The more any thing is stretched beyond
its usual nature, the less does it last; violence and
perpetuity being no companions. And then, besides,
suppose it is true, yet such a motion could
not well be applied to any use, which will needs
take much from the delight of it.</p>

<p>Amongst the chemical experiments to this
purpose may be reckoned up that famous motion
invented by Cornelius Dreble, and made for King
James; wherein was represented the constant revolutions
of the sun and moon, and that without
the help either of springs or weights. Marcellus
Vranckhein, speaking of the means whereby it
was performed, he calls it <i>Scintillula animae magneticae
mundi, seu astralis et insensibilis spiritus</i>;
being that grand secret for the discovery of
which those dictators of philosophy, Democritus,
Pythagoras, Plato, did travel unto the Gymnosophists
and Indian Priests. The author himself,
in his discourse upon it, does not at all reveal
the way how it was performed. But there is one
Thomas Tymme who was a familiar acquaintance
of his, and did often pry into his works (as he
professes himself), who affirms it to be done thus:
By extracting a fiery spirit out of the mineral
matter, joining the same with his proper air,
which included in the axletree (of the first
moving wheel), being hollow, carried the other
wheels, making a continual rotation, except issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
or vent be given in this hollow axletree, whereby
the imprisoned spirit may get forth.</p>

<p>What strange things may be done by such
extractions I know not, and, therefore, dare not
condemn this relation as impossible; but I think
it sounds rather like a chemical dream than a philosophical
truth. It seems this imprisoned spirit
is now set at liberty, or else is grown weary, for
the instrument (as I have heard) has stood still
for many years. It is here considerable that any
force is weakest near the center of a wheel; and
therefore, though such a spirit might of itself
have an agitation, yet 'tis not easily conceivable
how it should have strength enough to carry the
wheels about with it. And then, the absurdity of
the author's citing this, would make one mistrust
his mistake. He urges it as a strong argument
against Copernicus; as if, because Dreble did thus
contrive in an engine the revolution of the
heavens and the immovableness of the earth,
therefore it must needs follow that 'tis the
heavens which are moved, and not the earth. If
his relation were no truer than his consequence,
it had not been worth the citing.</p>

<h4 class="hang">CHAP. XIII.&mdash;<i>Concerning several attempts of
contriving a Perpetual Motion, by Magnetical
Virtues.</i></h4>

<p>The second way whereby the making of a
perpetual motion has been attempted, is by Magnetical
Virtues, which are not without some
strong probabilities of proving effectual to this
purpose; especially when we consider that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
heavenly revolutions (being as the first pattern
imitated and aimed at in these attempts) are all
of them performed by the help of these qualities.
This great orb of earth, and all the other planets,
being but as so many magnetical globes, endowed
with such various and continual motions as may
be most agreeable to the purposes for which they
were intended. And, therefore, most of the authors
who treat concerning this invention, do
agree that the likeliest way to effect it, is by these
kind of qualities.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of Pet. Peregrinus, and
there is an example pretended for it in Bettinus
(apiar. 9, progym. 5, pro. 11) that a magnetical
globe, or terella, being rightly placed upon its
poles, would of itself have a constant rotation,
like the diurnal motion of the earth. But this is
commonly exploded as being against all experience.</p>

<p>Others think it possible so to contrive several
pieces of steel and loadstone that, by their continual
attraction and expulsion of one another,
they may cause a perpetual revolution of a wheel.
Of this opinion were Taisner, Pet. Peregrinus,
and Cardan, out of Antonius de Fantis. But D.
Gilbert, who was more especially versed in magnetical
experiments, concludes it to be a vain and
groundless fancy.</p>

<p>But amongst all these kinds of inventions,
that is most likely, wherein a loadstone is so disposed
that it shall draw unto it on a reclined plane
a bullet of steel, which steel, as it ascends near to
the loadstone, may be contrived to fall down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
through some hole in the plane, and so to return
unto the place from whence at first it began to
move; and, being there, the loadstone will again
attract it upwards till coming to this hole, it will
fall down again; and so the motion shall be perpetual,
as may be more easily conceivable by this
figure:</p>

<div id="if_i_287" class="figcenter" style="width: 204px;"><img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="204" height="135" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Suppose the loadstone to be represented at
A B, which, though it have not strength enough
to attract the bullet C directly from the ground,
yet may do it by the help of the plane E F. Now,
when the bullet is come to the top of this plane,
its own gravity (which is supposed to exceed the
strength of the loadstone) will make it fall into
that hole at E; and the force it receives in this
fall will carry it with such a violence unto the
other end of this arch, that it will open the passage
which is there made for it, and by its return will
again shut it; so that the bullet (as at the first)
is in the same place whence it was attracted, and,
consequently, must move perpetually.</p>

<p>But, however, this invention may seem to be
of such strong probability, yet there are sundry
particulars which may prove it insufficient; <span class="locked">for&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
1. This bullet of steel must first be touched,
and have its several poles, or else there can be
little or no attraction of it. Suppose C in the steel
to be answerable unto A in the stone, and to B;
in the attraction C D must always be directed
answerable to A B, and so the motion will be
more difficult; by reason there can be no rotation
or turning round of the bullet, but it must slide up
with the line C D, answerable to the axis A B.</p>

<p>2. In its fall from E to G, which is <i>motus
elementaris</i>, and proceeds from its gravity, there
must needs be a rotation of it; and so 'tis odds but
it happens wrong in the rise, the poles in the bullet
being not in the same direction to those in the
magnet; and if in this reflux it should so fall out,
that D should be directed towards B, there should
be rather a flight than an attraction, since those
two ends do repel, and not draw one another.</p>

<p>3. If the loadstone A B have so much
strength, that it can attract the bullet in F, when
it is not turned round, but does only slide upon
the plane, whereas its own gravity would rowl it
downwards; then it is evident the sphere of its
activity and strength would be so increased when
it approaches much nearer, that it would not need
the assistance of the plane, but would draw it
immediately to itself without that help; and so
the bullet would not fall down through the hole,
but ascend to the stone, and, consequently, cease
its motion: for, if the loadstone be of force
enough to draw the bullet on the plane, at the distance
F B, then must the strength of it be sufficient
to attract it immediately unto itself, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
is so much nearer as E B. And if the gravity of
the bullet be supposed so much to exceed the
strength of the magnet, that it cannot draw it directly
when it is so near, then will it not be able
to attract the bullet up the plane, when it is so
much further off.</p>

<p>So that none of all these magnetical experiments,
which have been as yet discovered, are
sufficient for the effecting of a perpetual motion,
though these kind of qualities seem most conducible
unto it; and perhaps, hereafter, it may be
contrived from them.</p>

<h4 class="hang">CHAP. XIV.&mdash;<i>The seeming probability of effecting
a Continual Motion by Solid Weights in
a Hollow Wheel or Sphere.</i></h4>

<p>The third way whereby the making of a perpetual
motion has been attempted is by the Natural
Affection of Gravity; when the heaviness of
several bodies is so contrived, that the same motion
which they give in their descent, may be able
to carry them up again.</p>

<p>But (against the possibility of any such invention)
it is thus objected by Cardan:&mdash;All sub-lunary
bodies have a direct motion either of ascent
or descent; which, because it does not refer
to some term, therefore cannot be perpetual, but
must needs cease when it is arrived at the place
unto which it naturally tends.</p>

<p>I answer, though this may prove that there
is no natural motion of any particular heavy body
which is perpetual, yet it does not hinder, but that
it is possible from them to contrive such an artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
revolution as shall constantly be the cause
of itself.</p>

<p>Those bodies which may be serviceable to
this purpose are distinguishable into two kinds:</p>

<p>1. Solid and consistent; as weights of metal,
or the like.</p>

<p>2. Fluid or sliding; as water, sand, etc.</p>

<p>Both these ways have been attempted by
many, though with very little or no success.
Other men's conjectures in this kind you may see
set down by divers authors. It would be too
tedious to repeat them over, or set forth their
draughts.</p>

<p>I shall only mention two new ones, which (if
I am not over-partial) seem altogether as probable
as any of these kinds that have been yet invented;
and, till experience had discovered their
defect and insufficiency, I did certainly conclude
them to be infallible.</p>

<p>The first of these contrivances was by solid
weights being placed in some hollow wheel or
sphere, unto which they should give a perpetual
revolution; for, as the philosopher has largely
proved, only a circular motion can properly be
perpetual.</p>

<p>But, for the better conceiving of this invention,
it is requisite that we rightly understand
some principles in Trochilicks, or the art of wheel
instruments; as, chiefly, the relation betwixt the
parts of a wheel and those of a balance; the several
proportions in the semi-diameter of a wheel
being answerable to the sides in a balance, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the weight is multiplied according to its distance
from the center.</p>

<div id="if_i_291" class="figcenter" style="width: 258px;"><img src="images/i_291.jpg" width="258" height="259" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Thus, suppose the center to be at A, and the
diameter of the wheel, D C, to be divided into
equal parts (as is here expressed), it is evident,
according to the former ground, that one pound
at C will equiponderate to five pound at B, because
there is such a proportion betwixt their several
distances from the center. And it is not material
whether or no these several weights be placed
horizontally; for though B do hang lower than C,
yet this does not at all concern the heaviness; or
though the plummet C were placed much higher
than it is at E, or lower at F, yet would it still retain
the same weight which it had at C; because
these plummets (as in the nature of all heavy
bodies), do tend downwards by a straight line;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
so that their several gravities are to be measured
by that part of the horizontal semi-diameter,
which is directly either below or above them.
Thus, when the plummet C shall be moved either
to G or H, it will lose one-third of its former
heaviness, and be equally ponderous as if it were
placed in the balance at No. 3; and if we suppose
it to be situated at I or K, then the weight
of it will lie wholly upon the center, and not at all
conduce to the motion of the wheel on either side;
so that the straight lines which pass through the
divisions of the diameter may serve to measure
the heaviness of any weight in its several situations.</p>

<p>These things thoroughly considered, it seems
very possible and easy for a man to contrive the
plummets of a wheel, that they may be always
heavier in their fall, than in their ascent; and so,
consequently, that they should give a perpetual
motion to the wheel itself; since it is impossible
for that to remain unmoved as long as one side in
it is heavier than the other.</p>

<p>For the performance of this, the weights
must be so ordered: 1. That in their descent they
may fall from the center, and in their ascent may
rise nearer to it. 2. That the fall of each plummet
may begin the motion of that which should
succeed it, as in the following diagram:</p>

<p>Where there are sixteen plummets, eight in
the inward circle, and as many in the outward.
(The inequality being to arise from their situation,
it is therefore most convenient that the number
of them be even.) The eight inward plummets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
are supposed to be in themselves so much heavier
than the other, that in the wheel they may be of
equal weight with those above them, and then the
fall of these will be of sufficient force to bring
down the other. For example, if the outward
be each of them four ounces, then the inward
must be five; because the outward is distant from
the center five of those parts whereof the inward
is but four. Each pair of these weights should
be joined together by a little string or chain,
which must be fastened about the middle, betwixt
the bullet and the center of that plummet which is
to fall first, and at the top of the other.</p>

<div id="if_i_293" class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;"><img src="images/i_293.jpg" width="255" height="256" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>When these bullets, in their descent, are at
their farthest distance from the center of the
wheel, then shall they be stopped, and rest on the
pins placed to that purpose; and so, in their rising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
there must be other pins to keep them in a convenient
posture and distance from the center, lest,
approaching too near unto it, they thereby become
unfit to fall when they shall come to the top of the
descending side.</p>

<p>This may be otherwise contrived with some
different circumstances, but they will all redound
to the same effect. By such an engine it seems
very probable that a man may produce perpetual
motion; the distance of the plummets from the
center increasing with weight on one side, and
their being tied to one another, causing a constant
succession in their falling.</p>

<p>But now, upon experience, I have found this
to be fallacious; and the reason may sufficiently
appear by a calculation of the heaviness of each
plummet, according to its several situation; which
may easily be done by those perpendiculars that
cut the diameter (as was before explained, and is
here expressed in five of the plummets on the
descending side). From such a calculation it
will be evident, that both the sides of this wheel
will equiponderate; and so consequently, that the
supposed inequality whence the motion should
proceed, is but imaginary and groundless. On the
descending side, the heaviness of each plummet
may be measured according to these numbers
(supposing the diameter of the wheel to be divided
into twenty parts, and each of those sub-divided
into four):</p>

<p>The sum of which last numbers is equal with
the former, and therefore both the sides of such
a wheel in this situation will equiponderate.</p>

<p>If it be objected, that the plummet A should
be contrived to pull down the other at B, and then
the descending side will be heavier than the other;
for answer to this, it is <span class="locked">considerable&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That these bullets towards the top of the
wheel, cannot descend till they come to a certain
kind of inclination.</p>

<p>2. That any lower bullet hanging upon the
other above it, to pull it down, must be conceived,
as if the weight of it were in that point where its
string touches the upper; at which point this bullet
will be of less heaviness in respect of the wheel,
than if it did rest in its own place; so that both
the sides of it, in any kind of situation, may
equiponderate.</p>

<h4 class="hang">CHAP. XV.&mdash;<i>Of composing, a Perpetual Motion
by Fluid Weights&mdash;Concerning Archimedes
his Water Screw&mdash;The great probability of
accomplishing this enquiry by the help of
that, with the fallibleness of it upon experiment.</i></h4>

<p>That which I shall mention as the last way,
for the trial of this experiment, is by contriving it
in some Water Instrument; which may seem altogether
as probable and easy as any of the rest;
because that element, by reason of its fluid and
subtle nature (whereby, of its own accord, it
searches out the lower and more narrow passages),
may be most pliable to the mind of the artificer.
Now, the usual means for the ascent of
water is either by suckers or forces, or something
equivalent thereunto; neither of which may be
conveniently applied unto such a work as this,
because there is required unto each of them so
much or more strength, as may be answerable to
the full weight of the water that is to be drawn
up; and then, besides, they move for the most part
by fits and snatches, so that it is not easily conceivable,
how they should conduce unto such a
motion, which, by reason of its perpetuity, must
be regular and equal.</p>

<p>But, amongst all other ways to this purpose,
that invention of Archimedes is incomparably the
best, which is usually called <i>Cochlea</i>, or the Water
Screw; being framed by the helical revolution of
a cavity about a cylinder. We have not any discourse
from the author himself concerning it,
nor is it certain whether he ever writ anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
to this purpose; but if he did, yet, as the injury of
time hath deprived us of many other of his excellents
works, so likewise of this amongst the rest.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Near five pages are occupied in describing
the use of this screw, and the form and manner
of making it; then follows:]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The true inclination of the screw being
found, together with the certain quantity of water
which every helix does contain; it is further considerable,
that the water by this instrument does
ascend naturally of itself, without any violence
or labor; and that the heaviness of it does lie
chiefly upon the centers or axis of the cylinder,
both its sides being of equal weight (said Ubaldus);
so that, it should seem, though we suppose
each revolution to have an equal quantity of
water, yet the screw will remain with any part
upwards, according as it shall be set, without
turning itself either way; and, therefore, the least
strength being added to either of its sides should
make it descend, according to that common
maxim of Archimedes&mdash;any addition will make
that which equiponderates with another to tend
downwards.</p>

<p>But now, because the weight of this instrument
and the water in it does lean wholly upon the
axis, hence is it (said Ubaldus) that the grating
and rubbing of these axes against the sockets
wherein they are placed, will cause some ineptitude
and resistency to that rotation of the cylinder;
which would otherwise ensue upon the addition
of the least weight to any one side; but (said
the same author) any power that is greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
this resistency which does arise from the axis,
will serve for the turning of it round.</p>

<p>These things considered together, it will
hence appear how a perpetual motion may seem
easily contrivable. For, if there were but such a
water-wheel made on this instrument, upon which
the stream that is carried up may fall in its descent,
it would turn the screw round, and by that
means convey as much water up as is required to
move it; so that the motion must needs be continual,
since the same weight which in its fall
does turn the wheel is, by the turning of the wheel,
carried up again.</p>

<p>Or, if the water, falling upon one wheel,
would not be forcible enough for this effect, why
then there might be two or three, or more, according
as the length and elevation of the instrument
will admit; by which means the weight of it may
be so multiplied in the fall that it shall be equivalent
to twice or thrice that quantity of water
which ascends; as may be more plainly discerned
by the following diagram:</p>

<div id="if_i_299" class="figcenter" style="width: 257px;"><img src="images/i_299.jpg" width="257" height="352" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Where the figure L M, at the bottom, does
represent a wooden cylinder with helical cavities
cut in it, which at A B is supposed to be covered
over with tin plates, and three water-wheels upon
it, H I K; the lower cistern, which contains the
water, being C D. Now, this cylinder being
turned round, all the water which from the cistern
ascends through it, will fall into the vessel at E,
and from that vessel being conveyed upon the
water-wheel H, shall consequently give a circular
motion to the whole screw. Or, if this alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
should be too weak for the turning of it, then the
same water which falls from the wheel H, being
received into the other vessel F, may from thence
again descend on the wheel I, by which means the
force of it will be doubled. And if this be yet unsufficient,
then may the water which falls on the
second wheel I, be received into the other vessel
G, and from thence again descend on the third
wheel at K; and so for as many other wheels as
the instrument is capable of. So that, besides the
greater distance of these three streams from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
center or axis by which they are made so much
heavier, and besides that the fall of this outward
water is forcible and violent, whereas the ascent
of that within is natural&mdash;besides all this, there
is thrice as much water to turn the screw as is
carried up by it.</p>

<p>But, on the other side, if all the water falling
upon one wheel would be able to turn it round,
then half of it would serve with two wheels, and
the rest may be so disposed of in the fall as to
serve unto some other useful delightful ends.</p>

<p>When I first thought of this invention, I
could scarce forbear, with Archimedes, to cry out
εὕρηκα, εὕρηκα {heurêka, heurêka}; it seeming so infallible a way
for the effecting of a perpetual motion that nothing
could be so much as probably objected against
it; but, upon trial and experience, I find it altogether
insufficient for any such purpose, and that
for these two reasons:</p>

<p>1. The water that ascends will not make any
considerable stream in the fall.</p>

<p>2. This stream, though multiplied, will not
be of force enough to turn about the screw.</p>

<p>1. The water ascends gently, and by intermissions;
but it falls continually, and with force;
each of the three vessels being supposed full at
the first, that so the weight of the water in them
might add the greater strength and swiftness to
the streams that descend from them. Now, this
swiftness of motion will cause so great a difference
betwixt them that one of these little streams
may spend more water in the fall than a stream
six times bigger in the ascent, though we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
suppose both of them to be continuate; how much
more, then, when as the ascending water is vented
by fits and intermissions, every circumvolution
voiding so much as is contained in one helix; and,
in this particular, one that is not versed in these
kind of experiments may be easily deceived.</p>

<p>But, secondly, though there were so great a
disproportion, yet, notwithstanding, the force of
these outward streams might well enough serve
for the turning of the screw, if it were so that
both its sides would equiponderate the water being
in them (as Ubaldus had affirmed). But now,
upon farther examination, we shall find this assertion
of his to be utterly against both reason
and experience. And herein does consist the chief
mistake of this contrivance; for the ascending
side of the screw is made, by the water contained
in it, so much heavier than the descending side,
that these outward streams, thus applied, will not
be of force enough to make them equiponderate,
much less to move the whole, as may be more
easily discerned by this figure:</p>

<p>Where A B represents a screw covered over,
C D E one helix or revolution of it, C D the ascending
side, E D the descending side, the point D
the middle; the horizontal line C F showing how
much of the helix is filled with water, viz., of the
ascending side, from C the beginning of the helix,
to D the middle of it; and on the descending side,
from D the middle, to the point G, where the
horizontal does cut the helix. Now, it is evident
that this latter part, D G, is nothing near so much,
and consequently not so heavy as the other, D C;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
and thus is it in all the other revolutions, which,
as they are either more or larger, so will the difficulty
of this motion be increased. Whence it will
appear that the outward streams which descend
must be of so much force as to countervail all that
weight whereby the ascending side in every one
of these revolutions does exceed the other. And
though this may be effected by making the water-wheels
larger, yet then the motion will be so slow
that the screw will not be able to supply the outward
streams.</p>

<p>There is another contrivance to this purpose,
mentioned by Kircher de Magnete, 1, 2, p. 4, depending
upon the heat of the sun and the force of
winds; but it is liable to such abundance of exceptions
that it is scarce worth the mentioning, and
does by no means deserve the confidence of any
ingenious artist.</p>

<p>Thus have I briefly explained the probabilities
and defects of those subtle contrivances
whereby the making of a perpetual motion has
been attempted. I would be loath to discourage
the enquiry of any ingenious artificer by denying
the possibility of effecting it with any of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
mechanical helps; but yet (I conceive) if those
principles which concern the slowness of the
power in comparison to the greatness of the
weight were rightly understood and thoroughly
considered, they would make this experiment to
seem, if not altogether impossible, yet much more
difficult than otherwise, perhaps, it will appear.
However, the inquiring after it cannot but deserve
our endeavors, as being one of the most
noble amongst all these mechanical subtilties.
And, as it is in the fable of him who dug the vineyard
for a hidden treasure, though he did not
find the money, yet he thereby made the ground
more fruitful, so, though we do not attain to the
effecting of this particular, yet our searching
after it may discover so many other excellent subtilties
as shall abundantly recompense the labor of
our inquiry.</p>

<p>And then, besides, it may be another encouragement
to consider the pleasure of such
speculations, which do ravish and sublime the
thoughts with more clear angelical contentments.
Archimedes was generally so taken up in the delight
of these mathematical studies of this familiar
siren (as Plutarch styles them) that he
forgot both his meat and drink, and other necessities
of nature; nay, that he neglected the saving
of his life, when that rude soldier, in the pride and
haste of victory, would not give him leisure to finish
his demonstration. What a ravishment was
that, when, having found out the way to measure
Hiero's crown, he leaped out of the bath, and (as
if he were suddenly possessed) ran naked up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
down, crying εὕρηκα, εὕρηκα {Greek: heurêka, heurêka}! It is storied of
Thales that, in his joy and gratitude for one of
these mathematical inventions, he went presently
to the Temple, and there offered up a solemn
sacrifice; and Pythagoras, upon the like occasion,
is related to have sacrificed a hundred oxen; the
justice of Providence having so contrived it, that
the pleasure which there is in the success of such
inventions should be proportioned to the great
difficulty and labor of their inquiry.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Paradoxical Hydrostatic Balance</h3>

<p>The following was contributed to an English
scientific journal in 1831, the name of the author
of the article is unknown to us, but here is what
he wrote:</p>

<div id="if_i_304" class="figcenter" style="width: 155px;"><img src="images/i_304.jpg" width="155" height="156" alt="" /><br /></div>

<blockquote>

<p>This hydrostatic balance, like the compound
balance of Desaguliers, may be introduced to illustrate
the impossibility of perpetual motion by
a weight removed from the centre of a wheel.</p>

<p>Take the hollow-rimmed wheel A B; let it
be air-tight and half filled with water. Let C be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
the axle; at B place a hollow ball loaded to near
sinking. Such a wheel, however fine its axle may
be, or however well lubricated, will not make a
single revolution, though the weight B occupies
that part at which every deluded perpetual-motionist
is desirous it should be placed; concluding
that, by such an arrangement, the production of
another Orffyrean wheel must be inevitable.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Discussion by P. Gregorio Fontana</h3>

<p>P. Gregorio Fontana was professor of higher
mathematics at the Royal University of Pavia,
in the Province of Lombardy, Italy. In 1786 he
published what he designated "Examination of a
New Argument in Favor of Perpetual Motion."
In part he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. A vertical wheel (Fig. 2) divided in two
halves by a vertical plane which passes through
its diameter F O, has the half F P O immersed in
water under the level M N, and the other half
wholly out of the water, being cut off in F O by a
peculiar mechanism from all communication with
the reservoir, the exterior half of the wheel being
F Q O; this turns freely round on an axle passing
through the centre C. Now the wheel being specifically
lighter than the water, the immersed part
F P O comes with a continual rotation to the top
with a force equal to the excess of the weight of
a volume of water corresponding to the immersed
portion, over the weight of the immersed portion;
which rotation passing through the centre of
gravity of the exterior part, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
out of the centre C, obliges the wheel to turn
around C.</p>

<p>Such being the case, the question to be asked
is whether the wheel has itself a perpetual motion,
as may be judged at first sight.</p>

<div id="if_i_306" class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;"><img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="331" height="216" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>2. To reply adequately, it is at first necessary
to know what effect is produced on the wheel by
the horizontal pressure which the water exercises
on the semi-circumference F L O.</p>

<p>Having taken for this purpose, a part P <i>p</i>,
and having drawn to the diameter the ordinate
P. R, <i>p r</i>, and marked the radius P C, and from it
P G perpendicular to the radius C L, which determines
the quadrant O L, the distance of the
lowest point O from the level of the water will be
= <i>b</i>, the semi-diameter of the wheel = <i>a</i>, C R =
<i>x</i>, and the specific gravity of the water = 1; the
perpendicular pressure against the part P <i>p</i> =
P <i>p</i> . R D, which resolved in two, one horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
P R, the other vertical P G, gives the proportion</p>

<p class="in0">
PG : PR :: P<i>p</i> . RD : (P<i>p</i> . PR . RD) / (PG).<br />
</p>

<p>Thence the horizontal pressure against P <i>p</i>,
and = (P <i>p</i> . P R . R D .) / (P G), that is to say P <i>p</i> . P R
= R <i>r</i> . P G, the given horizontal pressure is found
to be = R <i>r</i> . R D = (<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>) <i>d</i> <i>x</i>, and which,
multiplied by R D, giving <i>b</i> - <i>x</i>, becomes the
momentum of the pressure relatively to M N =
(<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>)² <i>d</i> <i>x</i>, and the sum of the momenta of
pressure exercised upon the indefinite arc, O P
= <i>f</i> (<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>)² <i>d</i> <i>x</i> = -(1/3)(<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>)³ + the side.
And since acting together such momenta equal <i>x</i>,
there comes the side = (1/3)<i>b</i>³; and as the already-given
sum of the momenta = (1/3)(<i>b</i>³ - (<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>)³)
= <i>b² x</i> - <i>b x</i>² + (1/3)<i>x</i>³. Whence, taking <i>x</i> = 2<i>a</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
the sum of all the momenta of the horizontal
pressure exercised on the whole semi-circumference
O L F of the wheel, will be = 2<i>b</i>²<i>a</i> - 4<i>b</i> <i>a</i>²
+ (8/3)<i>a</i>³, and dividing that sum by the whole horizontal
pressure, that is to say by <i>f</i>(<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>)<i>d</i> <i>x</i> =
(1/2)(<i>b</i>² - (<i>b</i> - <i>x</i>)²) = <i>b</i> <i>x</i> - (1/2)<i>x</i>² = 2<i>b</i> <i>a</i> - 2<i>a</i>²,
gives <i>x</i> = 2<i>a</i>, we have the formula</p>

<p class="in0">(2<i>b</i>² - 4<i>b</i> <i>a</i> + (8/3)<i>a</i>³) /
(2<i>b</i> <i>a</i> - 2<i>a</i>²) = (<i>b</i>² -
2<i>b</i> <i>a</i> + (4/3)<i>a</i>²) / (<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) =
((<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>)² + (1/3)<i>a</i>²) / (<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) =
<i>b</i> - <i>a</i> + ((2/3)<i>a</i>²) / (<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>),
</p>

<p class="in0">which represents the distance of the level M N
from the result of all the horizontal pressure
against the circumference, which distance exceeds
D C, and consequently the direction of the result
passes from below the centre C of the wheel to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
distance from the said centre, which is = ((1/3)<i>a</i>²)/(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>If this distance be multiplied by the result of
all the horizontal pressure, that is, by 2<i>a</i>.(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>);
there is obtained (2/3)<i>a</i>³ for the momentum of
the force which tends to make the wheel revolve
from L towards O. This being established, it is
known that the force which causes the half of the
wheel F L G to revolve vertically to the top (calling
<i>g</i> the specific gravity of the wheel) is = (1 -
<i>g</i>) F C O L, and which force passes through
the center of gravity of F L O. And consequently
the gravity of any circular segment
divided by the half of the radius, is distant from
the centre of the circle by a quantity equal to the
twelfth of the cube of the chord divided by the
segment; and therefore the centre of gravity of
the semicircle F C O L, will be distant from the
centre C by the quantity (1/12)8<i>a</i>³/(E C O L) = (2/3)<i>a</i>³/(E C O L).
Consequently the momentum of this force tending
to make the wheel revolve from O towards L will
be = (2/3<i>a</i>³)/(E C O L) . (1 - <i>g</i>)(E C O L) = 2/3(1 - <i>g</i>)<i>a</i>³.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
</p>

<p>But moreover a certain momentum will be
derived from the other half F Q O of the wheel,
which being out of the water, tends by its own
weight downwards with a force = <i>g</i> . (E C O Q) =
<i>g</i> . (E C O L), which multiplied by the distance
(2/1<i>a</i>³)/(E C O L) of the centre of gravity of the semicircle
F Q O from the centre of the wheel gives
as a momentum of force tending to turn the wheel
from O to L the quantity 2/3<i>g</i> <i>a</i>³. Thus the whole
momentum to make the wheel turn from O to L,
will be 2/3(1 - <i>g</i>)<i>a</i>³, + 2/3<i>g</i> <i>a</i>³ = 2/3<i>a</i>³, that is
to say the same that is found to turn the wheel in
the opposite direction, viz., from L to O, and
thence the wheel remains perfectly motionless.</p>

<p>3. Cor. I. If the wheel were specifically
heavier than the water, one would not be able to
conceive in that case any motion from L to O, as
seemed probable in the former supposition. Since,
then, the momentum of the force, which turns
vertically downwards the portion of the wheel
F C O L, and tends to make it revolve from L to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
O is = 2/3(<i>g</i> - 1)<i>a</i>³ to which momentum should
be added a certain portion of the horizontal pressure,
that is to say 2/3, and thus is obtained the
whole momentum 2/3<i>g</i> <i>a</i>³, tending to cause the
wheel to turn from L to O; and to which momentum
precisely, is equal such of the weight of the
half F C O Q as tends to give to the wheel a contrary
revolution, that is, from O to L.</p>

<p>3. Cor. II. If the wheel in place of being a
circular plane were a zone bounded by two concentric
peripheries (Fig. 3), then from the sum
of the horizontal pressure of the water against
the exterior periphery should be taken the sum
of the opposite horizontal pressure against the
other interior semi-periphery of the zone. So
calling <i>a</i> the greater radius of the zone, and λ its
breadth, the sum of the first horizontal pressure
is = 2<i>a</i>(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) and the sum of the second = 2(<i>a</i> - λ)(<i>b</i> - λ) - (<i>a</i> - λ)
= 2(<i>a</i> - λ)(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>).
Then subtract the latter from the former
and there remains 2(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>)λ for the sum of the
whole pressure, which acts upon the zone (<i>sic</i>) of
the half of the wheel immersed in the fluid in a
direction tending from the outside to the interior
of the wheel.</p>

<p>Moreover the sum of the momenta of all the
horizontal pressure on the exterior circumference
relatively to the level</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p class="center">M N is = 2<i>b</i> <i>a</i> - 4<i>b</i> <i>a</i> + 8/3<i>a</i>³.</p>

<p>And similarly the sum of the momenta of
the horizontal pressure opposite, on the interior
semi-circumference, relatively to the given level is
= 2(<i>b</i> - λ)² - (<i>a</i> - λ) - 4(<i>b</i> - λ) × (<i>a</i> -
λ)² + 8/3(<i>a</i> - λ)³.</p>

<p>Subtracting this sum from the preceding,
there remains the sum of the momenta acting on
the zone of the half-wheel from the exterior to
the interior = 2<i>b</i>² <i>a</i> - 4<i>b</i> <i>a</i>² + 8/3<i>a</i>³ - 2(<i>b</i> -
λ)² (<i>a</i> - λ) + 4(<i>b</i> - λ) (<i>a</i> - λ)² - 8/3(<i>a</i> - λ)³
- 2<i>b</i>² λ - 4<i>b</i> <i>a</i> λ + 4<i>a</i>² λ - 2<i>a</i> λ² + 2/3λ³ = 2λ
(<i>b</i>(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) - <i>b</i> <i>a</i> + 2<i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²) = 2λ
((<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>)(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) + <i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²) Then
dividing this sum of the momenta by the sum of
the pressure there will be
2λ(((<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>)(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) + <i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²)/(2λ(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>))) = <i>b</i>
+ <i>p</i> (<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²)/(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>)) the distance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
center of the pressure from the level of the fluid,
that is, to the distance of the result of all the
pressure from that level. From this it is evident
that the center of pressure falls under the center
of the wheel, C, to the distance (<i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²)/(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>) .</p>

<p>Whence multiplying this distance by the result
of the pressure, or by 2λ(<i>b</i> - <i>a</i>), we obtain
2λ(<i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²) to express the momentum
of the horizontal pressure of the water, directed
to make the wheel turn from L to O.</p>

<p>Now the momentum with which the vertical
impulse of the fluid tends to make the semicircle
F C O L turn from O to L (supposing the wheel
not with a simple zone, but with a circular plane)
is = 2/3<i>a</i>³. Likewise the momentum of the impulse
of the fluid to cause the internal semicircle
V C I G from O to L is - 2/3(<i>a</i> - λ)³. Then
taking this second momentum from the first, the
momentum of the zone from the fluid V G I O
L F to give the wheel an impulse from O to L will
be = 2/3(<i>a</i>³ - (<i>a</i> - λ)³) = 2λ(<i>a</i>² - <i>a</i>λ + 1/3λ²)
which is precisely the momentum with which the
horizontal pressure of the fluid to impress on the
wheel an impulse in the opposite direction, that is
to say from L to O. Consequently from the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
of the fluid the wheel cannot have any motion
around its center.</p>

<p>The weight of the wheel itself, by which the
half-zone immersed in the water tends to make
the wheel turn from L to O, and the half which
is out of the water, to make it turn in the reverse
direction, such a weight, I say, cannot induce any
motion of rotation, and both halves remain in
equilibrium around the center C.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Article by William Nicholson</h3>

<p>William Nicholson was born in London in
1753; died in 1815. He was a scientist of note,
and a writer of scientific subjects. In 1797 he
established in London and continued publishing
until 1814, a periodical entitled "Journal of Natural
Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts,"
known, however, throughout the civilized world
as "Nicholson's Journal."</p>

<p>A Perpetual Motion device of Dr. Conradus
Schwiers, in 1790, and the Richard Varley device,
in 1797, described at page 132 et seq., ante, had
attracted a great deal of attention, and were the
occasion of much discussion. A consequent increased
interest in the subject of self-moving
mechanism was thus created.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholson, whose scientific attainments
were recognized by all, was asked to publish an
article on the subject. His article appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
his publication, "Nicholson's Journal," and is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<h4><i>On the Mechanical Projects for Affording a Perpetual Motion</i></h4>

<p>In consequence of the notice taken of Mr.
Varley's attempt to produce a perpetual motion,
I have been requested by several correspondents
to state how far the mechanical scheme for which
Dr. Conrad Schwiers took out a patent in the
year 1790, for the same object may be worthy of
attention. I have, on that occasion, mentioned
the difficulties which have prevented any clear
general demonstration of the absurdity of this
pursuit from being produced, though it has not
been difficult to show the fallacy of the individual
plans. It does not, indeed, seem easy to enunciate
the scheme itself. What in universal terms is the
thing proposed to be done? Is it to cause a body
to act in such a manner that the reaction shall be
greater than the action itself, and by that means
generate force by the accumulation of the surplus?
Or, can the motion communicated be
greater than that lost by the agent? Since these
positions are evidently contrary to the physical
axioms called the laws of nature, and frictions
and resistances would speedily destroy all motions
of simple uniformity, it may be presumed that
's Gravesande, who thought that all the demonstrations
of the absurdity of schemes for perpetual
motion contained paralogism, would have
stated the proposition under different terms.
But without entering upon this apparently unprofitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
disquisition, it may be useful, as well
as entertaining, to make a few observations on
the mechanical contrivances which depend on a
mistaken deduction from the general theorem respecting
the balance, among which that of Dr.
Schwiers must be classed.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but numerous arrangements
have been made, and still are labored at by
various individuals, to produce a machine which
shall possess the power of moving itself perpetually,
notwithstanding the inevitable loss by friction
and resistance of the air. Little, however,
of these abortive exertions has been entered upon
record. The plans of Bishop Wilkins, the Marquis
of Worcester, and M. Orffyreus, are all
which at this time occur to my recollection.</p>

<div id="if_i_317" class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;"><img src="images/i_317.jpg" width="220" height="262" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>There is no doubt but the celebrated Wilkins
was a man of learning and ability. His essay
towards a real character and a philosophical language
is sufficient to render his name immortal.
Twenty years before the appearance of that work
he published his "Mathematical Magic," namely,
in the year 1648, containing 295 pages, small
octavo, which, from the number of copies still in
being, I suppose to have been a very popular
treatise. It is in this work that I find, among
other contrivances for the same purpose, a wheel
carrying sixteen loaded arms, similar to that delineated
in Fig. 4, plate 15, in which, however,
for the sake of simplicity, I have drawn but six.
Each lever, A B C D E F, is movable through an
angle of 45 degrees, by a joint near the circumference
of the wheel, and the inner end or tail of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
each is confined by two studs or pins, so that it
must either lie in the direction of a radius, or else
in the required position of obliquity. If the
wheel be now supposed to move in the direction
E F, it is evident that the levers A B C D, by
hanging in the oblique position against the antecedent
pins, will describe a less circle in their
ascent than when, on the other side, they come
to descend in the positions E F. Hence, it was
expected that the descending weights, having the
advantage of a longer lever, would always predominate.
Dr. Wilkins, by referring the weights
to an horizontal diameter, has shown that in his
machine they will not. A popular notion of this
result may also be gathered from the figure,
where there are three weights on the ascending
and only two on the descending side; the obliquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
of position giving an advantage in point of number,
equal to what the other side may possess in
intensity. Or, if this contrivance were to be
strictly examined, on the supposition that the
levers and weights were indefinitely numerous,
the question would be determined by showing that
the circular arcs A K, H I, are in equilibrio with
the arcs A G, G L.</p>

<p>The simplest method of examining any
scheme of this kind with weights, consists in inquiring
whether the perpendicular ascents and
descents would be performed with equal masses
in equal times. If so, there will be no preponderance,
and, consequently, no motion. This is
clearly the case with the contrivance before us.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester, who will ever be
remembered as the inventor of the steam engine,
has described a perpetual motion in the fifty-sixth
number of his "Century of Inventions," published
in the year 1655, and since reprinted in 1767 by
the Foulis's at Glasgow. His words were as follows:</p>

<p>"To provide and make, that all the weights of
the descending side of a wheel shall be perpetually
further from the center than those of the mounting
side, and yet equal in number and heft to the
one side as the other. A most incredible thing
if not seen, but tried before the late King (of
blessed memory) in the Tower by my directions,
two extraordinary ambassadors accompanying
his Majesty, and the Duke of Richmond and Duke
Hamilton, with most of the Court attending him.
The wheel was fourteen feet over, and forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
weights of fifty pounds apiece. Sir William Balfour,
then Lieutenant of the Tower, can justify
it with several others. They all saw that no
sooner these great weights passed the diameter
line of the lower side, but they hung a foot further
from the center; nor no sooner passed the diameter
line of the upper side, but they hung a foot
nearer. Be pleased to judge the consequence."</p>

<div id="if_i_320" class="figcenter" style="width: 161px;"><img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="161" height="184" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>Desaguliers, in his "Course of Experimental
Philosophy," Vol. I, page 185, has quoted this
passage, and given a sketch of a pretended self-moving
wheel, similar to Fig. 5, plate 15, as resembling
the contrivance mentioned by the Marquis
of Worcester. The description of this last
engineer agrees, however, somewhat better with
the contrivance Fig. 4. It must, of course, be a
mistake in terms, when he says the weight receded
from the center at the lower diameter and
approached towards it at the upper: the contrary
being, in fact, necessary to afford any hope of
success; and accordingly in the quotation it is so
stated. I am, therefore, disposed to think that
Fig. 5 represents the wheel of Orffyreus at Hesse
Cassel, much talked of about the year 1720, and
which probably was made to revolve, during the
time of exhibition, by some concealed apparatus.
It consists of a number of cells or partitions, distinguished
by the letters of the alphabet, which
are made between the interior and exterior surfaces
of two concentric cylinders. The partitions
being placed obliquely with respect to the
radius, a cylindrical or spherical weight placed on
each, it is seen from the figure, that these weights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
will lie against the inner surface of the larger
cylinder whenever the outer end of the bottom
partition of any cell is lowest; and, on the contrary,
when that extremity is highest, the weight
will rest on the surface of the interior cylinder.
Let the wheel be made to revolve in the direction
A B C; the weights in C D E F G H I being close
to the external circle, and the weights K L M A B
close to the inner, for the reasons last mentioned.
As the cell B descends, its weight will likewise
run out, at the same time that the weight in the
cell I will run in in consequence of its partition
being elevated. By the continuation of this process,
since all the weights on the descending side
pass down at a greater distance from the center,
while those of the ascending side rise for a considerable
part of their ascent at a less distance
from the same point, it is concluded that the wheel
will continue to maintain its motion. On this,
however, it is to be remarked that the perpendicular
ascent and descent are alike, both in measure
and in time of performance; and that the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
examination, even to those who know little of
such subjects, is sufficient to show that the preponderance
is not quite so palpable as at first it
appears. For the weights G and F, H and E,
I and D are evidently in equilibrio, because at the
same horizontal distance from the center; and if
the favorable supposition that the weight B has
already run out be admitted, it will then remain a
question whether these two exterior weights, B
and C, can preponderate over the four inner
weights, K L M A. The more accurate examination
of this particular contrivance will lead to
the following theorem: In two concentric circles,
if tangents be drawn at the extreme points of a
diameter of the smaller, and continued till they
intersect the larger, the common center of gravity
of the arc of the greater circle included between
the tangents and of the half periphery of the
smaller circle on the opposite side of the diameter,
will be the common center of the circles.
If, therefore, the balls were indefinitely numerous
and small, the supposed effective parts of the
wheel (Fig. 5) would be in equilibrio, as well as
the parts beneath the horizontal tangent of the
inner circle.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 represents the contrivance of Dr.
Schwiers, which, in a periodical publication, in
other particulars respectable, has been said to
continue in motion for weeks and even months
together. There is not the smallest probability
that it should continue in motion for half a
minute, or nearly as long as a simple wheel would
retain part of its first impulse. The external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
circle denotes a wheel carrying a number of buckets,
A B I L, etc. C represents a toothed wheel,
on the same axis which drives a pinion D; and
this last drives another pinion E upon the axis of
a lanthorn, or wheel intended to work a chain-pump
with the same number of buckets as in the
larger wheel A B I. The lanthorn G is made of
such a size as to receive the buckets <i>a b i l</i> with a
due velocity. K represents a gutter through
which a metallic ball, contained in the bucket <i>m</i>,
may run and lodge itself in the bucket A of the
wheel. Each of the buckets of the wheel, B I
L M, which are below the gutter, is supplied with
a metallic ball, and so likewise are the ascending
buckets, <i>a b i l m</i>, of the chain-pump. As the
pump supplies the wheel, it is again supplied at
M, where the balls fall into its ascending buckets.
Now, it is presumed that the balls in the wheel I
suppose on account of their distance from the
center of motion, will descend with more than
sufficient force to raise those on the chain, and,
consequently, that the motion will be perpetual.</p>

<p>The deception in this contrivance has much
less seduction than in the two foregoing, because
it is more easily referred to the simple lever.
This, like the others, exhibits no prospect of success,
when tried by the simple consideration of
the quality of the ascent and descent in the whole
time of the rotation of a single ball. It may also
be shown from the principles of wheel-work,
which are familiar to artisans, that whatever is
gained by the excess of the diameter of the great
wheel beyond that of the wheel C, is again lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
by the excess of the lanthorn A beyond the
pinion E.</p>

<div id="if_i_323" class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;"><img src="images/i_323.jpg" width="356" height="385" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The fundamental proposition of the simple
lever or balance, that equal bodies at an equal distance
from the fulcrum will equiponderate, but
that at unequal distances the most remote will
descend, has, in these and numberless other instances,
led mechanical workmen and speculators
to pursue this fruitless inquiry with labor and expense
often ill-afforded, and with a degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
anxiety and infatuation which can hardly be conceived
by those who have never suffered the pain
of hope long deferred. For this reason chiefly,
it has appeared desirable and useful to treat the
subject in a familiar way without descending to
those expressions of contempt, which ignorance,
harmless to all but itself, is surely not entitled to.
If such reasoners were well convinced that the
power of a machine is to be estimated by the
excess of motion referred to the perpendicular,
without any regard to the apparent center of the
machine, and that in machines very little compounded
it is possible to produce effects directly
contrary to the rule which is true of the simple
lever, they would probably renounce many flattering
projects, grounded only on the supposition
of its universality. Desaguliers contrived an apparatus
in which two equal weights may be placed
at any distance whatever from the center of motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
and still continue in equilibrio. Fig. 3 represents
this instrument. A D denotes a balance
with equal arms, and E F another of the same
dimensions. These move on the centers B and C,
and are connected by the inflexible rods A E and
D F; the motion being left free by means of joints
at the corners. Across the rods A D, E F, are
fixed two bars, I K, L M. Now, it is unnecessary
to show that the weight G will describe exactly
the same line or circular arc, when the levers are
moved into the position <i>a d f e</i>, or any other position,
as it would have described in case it had been
suspended at A, or K, or E; and that it is of no
consequence in this respect at what part of the
line A E or I K it be fixed. The same observations
are true of the weight H on the other side.
And accordingly it is found that these equal
weights may be suspended anywhere on the lines
I K and L M without altering their equilibrium.</p>

<div id="if_i_324" class="figcenter" style="width: 257px;"><img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="257" height="221" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>By this contrivance it is most evidently
proved to those who are totally unacquainted with
the theory, that weights do not preponderate in
compound engines on account of their distance
from the center. Several contrivances may be
made to the same effect. The following combination
of wheel-work presented itself to me as one
which would most probably be mistaken for a perpetual
motion. (Fig. 2, plate 15.) The five
circles represent the same number of wheels of
equal diameter and number of teeth, acting together.
The middle wheel A is fixed between
two upright pillars, so that it cannot revolve. The
other four wheels are pinned in a frame H I, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
which they can revolve, and through which the
axis of A likewise passes. From the extremity
of the axis of D, and also of <i>d</i>, proceed the horizontal
levers H K and I L, which are equal, and
point in the same direction parallel to the plane
of the wheels. At the extremity of these arms
hang the equal weights P and <i>p</i>. Let it now be
imagined that the end I of the frame is depressed,
the wheel B will turn round by the reaction
of the fixed wheel A in the same direction
as H I, and it will make one revolution in the
same time relative to the frame, or two with regard
to absolute space, by reason of its being
carried round. The action of B upon D will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
produce a rotation relative to the frame in the
opposite direction during the same time. Instead,
therefore, of two revolutions like the wheel B,
this wheel D, with regard to absolute space, will
not revolve at all, and in every position of the
apparatus the arm I L will continue horizontal,
and point the same way. For similar reasons the
arm H K will retain its position. Consequently,
it is seen that the descending weight will move
at a great horizontal distance from the center N,
while the ascending weight rises very near that
center. But there will, not on this account, be a
perpetual motion: for the action of the levers
H K and I L upon the frame H I, by means of the
toothed wheels, will, in the detail, be found precisely
alike, and in the general consideration of
the motions of P and <i>p</i>, the opposite motions in
the circle E F G will be accurately the same.</p>

<div id="if_i_326" class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;"><img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="391" height="302" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>It has always been considered as essential
to a perpetual motion that it should be derived
from some energy which is not supposed to vary
in its intensity. Such are the inertia, the gravity
or magnetism of bodies. For an occasional or
periodical variation of intensity in any force is
evidently productive of motion, which requires
only to be accumulated or applied, and the apparatus
for applying it cannot be considered as a
machine for perpetual motion. Neither in strictness
can any machine whose motion is derived
from the rotation of the earth, and the consequent
change of seasons and rotation of events, be so
considered, because it does not generate, but only
communicates. The perpetual flow of rivers; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
vicissitudes of the tides; the constant, periodical
and variable winds; the expansions and contractions
of air, mercury, or other fluids, by daily
or other changes of temperature; the differences
of expansions in metals, by the same change; the
rise and fall of the mercury in the barometer; the
hygrometric changes in the remains of organized
beings, and every other mutation which continually
happens around us, may be applied to give
motion to mills, clocks, and other engines, which
may be contrived to endure as long as the apparatus
retains its figure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Nicholson's article, published above,
shows, if nothing else had ever shown, the fact
that he was endowed with a real scientific mind.
It also shows what is still most interesting&mdash;that
his mind anticipated and that he had a subconscious
conception of the principle of Conservation
of Energy.</p>

<p>In 1824 and 1825 there was published in
London a mechanical journal called "The Artisan";
or "Mechanic's Instructor." In one of
the issues the following occurred on the subject
of Perpetual Motion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Perpetual motion is a motion which is supplied
and renewed from itself without the intervention
of any external cause: to find a perpetual
motion, or to construct a machine which shall
have such a motion, is a subject which has engaged
the attention of mathematicians for more
than 2,000 years; though none perhaps have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
prosecuted it with so much zeal and hopes of ultimate
success as some of the speculative philosophers
of the present age.</p>

<p>Infinite are the schemes, designs, plans, engines,
wheels, etc., to which this longed-for perpetual
motion has given birth; and it would not
only be endless but ridiculous to attempt to give
a detail of them all, especially as none of them
deserve particular mention, since they have all
equally proved abortive; and it would rather partake
of the nature of an affront than a compliment,
to distinguish the pretenders of this discovery,
as the very attempting of the thing conveys
a very unfavorable idea of the mental powers
of the operator.</p>

<p>For among all the laws of matter and motion,
we know of none which seems to afford any principle
or foundation for such an effect. Action
and reaction are allowed to be ever equal; and a
body which gives any quantity of motion to another,
always loses just so much of its own; but,
under the present state of things, the resistance
of the air, and the friction of the parts of machines,
necessarily retard every motion.</p>

<p>To keep the motion going on, therefore, there
must either be a supply from some foreign cause,
which, in a perpetual motion, is excluded.</p>

<p>Or, all resistance from the friction of the
parts of matter must be removed; which necessarily
implies a change in the nature of things.</p>

<p>For by the second law of motion the changes
made in the motions of bodies are always proportional
to the impressed moving force, and are produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
in the same direction with it; no motion,
then, can be communicated to any engine, greater
than that of the first force impressed.</p>

<p>But, on our earth, all motion is performed
in a resisting fluid, namely, the atmosphere, and
must, therefore, of necessity, be retarded; consequently,
a considerable quantity of its motion will
be spent on the medium. Nor is there any engine
or machine wherein all friction can be avoided;
there being in nature no such thing as exact
smoothness or perfect congruity; the manner of
the cohesion of the parts of bodies, the small proportion
which the solid matter bears to the vacuities
between them, and the nature of those constituent
particles not admitting it.</p>

<p>Friction, therefore, will also, in time, sensibly
diminish the impressed or communicated force;
so that a perpetual motion can never follow, unless
the communicated force be so much greater
than the generating force as to supply the diminution
occasioned by all these causes; but the generating
force cannot communicate a greater degree
of motion than it had itself. Therefore, the
whole affair of finding a perpetual motion comes
to this, viz., to make a weight heavier than itself,
or an elastic force greater than itself; or, there
must be some method of gaining a force equivalent
to what is lost by the artful disposition and
combination of the mechanical powers: to this last
point then, all endeavors are to be directed; but
how, or by what means such a force can be gained,
is still a mystery!</p>

<p>The multiplication of powers or forces avails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
nothing; for what is gained in power is lost in
time; so that the quantity of motion still remains
the same.</p>

<p>The whole science of mechanics cannot really
make a little power equal or superior to a larger;
and wherever a less power is found in equilibrio
with a greater&mdash;as, for example, twenty-five
pounds with one hundred&mdash;it is a kind of deception
of the sense; for the equilibrium is not
strictly between one hundred pounds and twenty-five
pounds moving (or disposed to move) four
times as fast as the one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>A power of ten pounds moving with ten
times the velocity of one hundred pounds would
have equalled the one hundred in the same manner;
and the same may be said of all the possible
products equal to one hundred: but there must
still be one hundred pounds of power on each side,
whatever way they may be taken, whether in
matter or in velocity.</p>

<p>This is an inviolable law of nature; by which
nothing is left to art, but the choice of the several
combinations that may produce the same effects.</p>

<p>The only interest that we can take in the
projects which have been tried for procuring a
perpetual motion must arise from the opportunity
that they afford of observing the weakness of
human reason.</p>

<p>For a better instance of this can scarcely be
supplied than to see a man spending whole years
in the pursuit of an object, which a single week's
application to sober philosophy would have convinced
him was unattainable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
But for the satisfaction of those who may
not be convinced of the impossibility of attaining
this grand object, we shall add a few observations
on the subject of a still more practical nature than
the above.</p>

<div id="if_i_332" class="figcenter" style="width: 206px;"><img src="images/i_332.jpg" width="206" height="260" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>The most satisfactory confutation of the notion
of the possibility of a perpetual motion is
derived from the consideration of the properties
of the center of gravity; it is only necessary to
examine whether it will begin to descend or
ascend when the machine moves, or whether it
will remain at rest. If it be so placed that it
must either remain at rest or ascend, it is clear,
from the laws of equilibrium, that no motion derived
from gravitation can take place; if it may
descend, it must either continue to descend forever
with a finite velocity, which is impossible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
or it must first descend and then ascend with a
vibratory motion, and then the case will be reducible
to that of a pendulum, where it is obvious
that no new motion is generated, and that the friction
and resistance of the air must soon destroy
the original motion.</p>

<p>One of the most common fallacies by which
the superficial projectors of machines for obtaining
a perpetual motion have been deluded, has
arisen from imagining that any number of
weights ascending by a certain path on one side
of the center of motion, and descending on the
other at a greater distance, must cause a constant
preponderance on the side of the descent; and for
this purpose weights have been made to slide or
roll along grooves or planes, which lead them to a
more remote part of the wheel, from whence they
return as they ascend, as represented in the following
figure: Or they have been fixed on hinges
which allow them to fall over at a certain point so
as to become more distant from the center; but it
will appear on the inspection of such a machine
that although some of the weights are more distant
from the center than others, yet there is
always a proportionally smaller number of them
on that side on which they have the greater
power; so that these circumstances precisely
counterbalance each other.</p>

<p>We have heard it proposed to attach hollow
arms to a wheel by joints or hinges at the circumference,
and to fill these arms with quicksilver or
small balls instead of the plan represented by the
above figure; but though we have never heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
it having been tried, we are perfectly convinced
that it would end as all other attempts have done;
that is, in a total failure.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Possibility of Perpetual Motion Asserted</h3>

<p>The enthusiastic earnestness with which the
subject of Perpetual Motion was formerly discussed
is illustrated by the fact that the Holy
Scriptures were dragged in to support arguments
on the proposition.</p>

<p>The following is a verbatim copy of an article
published in an English scientific magazine
in 1829:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Notice to Perpetual Motion Seekers."&mdash;The
following is a literal copy of a communication
which we have received under this head. We
publish it for the benefit of all concerned: "Perpetual
Motion Seekers! see Coloss., ch. ii., v. 8&mdash;'Beware
lest any man spoil you, through philosophy
and vain deceit, after the tradition of
men, after the rudiments of the world.' Ye are
making the words of God of none effect by your
traditions in publishing these things to the world.
How can such toys and baubles as these be perpetual?
See Malachi, ch. iv., v. 1&mdash;'For behold
the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and
all the proud, yea, all that do wickedly, shall be as
stubble.' Here is the end of them. I, the undersigned,
have to inform the public, the model
for making perpetual motion is to be found in that
too much neglected book of models, the Bible. I
called upon the Lord, and he showed it to me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
said, 'Lord, shall I show this unto them? This
was the answer to me: See Isaiah, ch. xli., v. 29&mdash;'Behold,
they are all vanity; their works are
nothing.' I said, 'Lord, be pleased to show me
some more about it.' 'Bring forth your strong
reasons, saith the King of Jacob.'&mdash;Isaiah, ch.

<h3>John Bernoulli's Dissertation on Perpetual
Motion</h3>

<p>John Bernoulli was born in 1667, and died in
1748. He belonged to the famous Belgian family
bearing the name. His family seems to have
been peculiarly prolific in men of great genius for
mathematics and science. Almost any encyclopedia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
with any pretense for thoroughness will
mention and give the sketch of the life of from
five to nine members of the Bernoulli family.</p>

<p>John Bernoulli possessed perhaps the greatest
genius of any bearing the name for pure
mathematics and pure mechanics. He was a
contemporary of such men as Leibnitz, Euler and
Newton, a co-laborer with the two former, but
never conceded the merits of Newton. He was
of a peculiar disposition, of intense likes and dislikes
and among his peculiarities it may be mentioned
that he harbored an unreasonable hatred
toward a worthy and deserving son.</p>

<p>In 1742 he wrote a work entitled "Dissertation
on Effervescence and Fermentation." To
this work he added an appendix entitled "Concerning
Artificial Perpetual Motion." The appendix
translated into English and as published
by Dircks, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Scarcely had I finished this dissertation,
when, attentively considering the nature of precipitation
and secretion, briefly explained in the
last pages, there accidentally occurred to me a
mode of constructing, by means of some continually
flowing liquid, the much-talked of and long-desired
Perpetual Artificial Motion; and this as a
completion to my work, on account of the affinity
of the subject, I now propose for the consideration
of the learned.</p>

<p>No one need be told how eagerly for a length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
of time this same Perpetual Motion has been
sought after by the most celebrated men, how
ardently desired; what indeed have they not contrived?
To what expense have they not gone?
How many machines have they not constructed?
But all in vain.</p>

<p>The secret desire of this Perpetual Motion
still perplexes and torments many, and excites
their minds to such a degree that we see the ears
and minds of learned men carried away by it; yet
many philosophers reject the idea, unanimously
asserting that Perpetual Motion cannot be communicated
and cannot be invented; which opinion
is nevertheless not of any weight, seeing that they
rashly judge that no one should be listened to
who boasts of having found out such a thing;
and their reasons (as I confess) do not suffice to
convince me; for I do not hesitate to assert not
only that Perpetual Motion may be discovered,
but that it has now actually been discovered, as
will be confessed by any one who reads these
lines; and what is this labor to many? does not
Nature herself (who is never said not to operate
by mechanical laws) indicate Perpetual Motion
to be possible? To recall but one instance, what is
the constant flux and reflux of the rivers and seas
but Perpetual Motion? Does it not all belong to
Mechanics? Therefore, you must confess that it
does not exceed the limits of mechanical laws, and
is not impossible; what then hinders that following
Nature in this, we should be able perfectly to
imitate her? as indeed I shall so conclude, by declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
to these the possibility of Perpetual Motion
and the manner of obtaining it; and lest thou
come to an adverse conclusion, or regard it as a
Titanic enterprise, I pray that thou mayest first
well weigh the thing, or, if it so please thee, put
its truth to the test of experience.</p>

<p>First of all the following must be premised:</p>

<p>1. If there are two fluids of different density,
the weights of which respectively are in the ratio
G to L; the altitudes of cylinders of equal weight,
and having the same base, will be in the ratio
L to G.</p>

<p>2. Therefore, if the altitude A C of one fluid
contained in the vessel A D to be the altitude
E F of the other fluid contained in an open tube,
as L to D; the fluids so placed will remain at rest.</p>

<div id="if_i_338" class="figleft" style="width: 157px;"><img src="images/i_338.jpg" width="157" height="182" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>3. Therefore, if A C to E F be in a greater
ratio than L to G, the fluid in the tube will ascend;
or if the tube be not sufficiently
long, the fluid will
escape by the orifice E.
(These are proved by Hydrostatics.)</p>

<p>4. It is possible to
have two fluids of different
gravity, which are
capable of being mixed
one with the other.</p>

<p>5. It is possible to
have a filter, strainer or other separator, by means
of which the lighter fluid may be separated from
the heavier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Construction</i></h4>

<p>These being pre-supposed, I construct Perpetual
Motion in the following manner:</p>

<p>Let two fluids of different gravity and capable
of mixing together (which is possible by Hyp.
4) be taken in any quantities, in equal quantities,
if desired; let the ratios of their gravities be first
determined, which suppose as G to L, the heavier
to the lighter; and being mixed, let a vessel, A D,
be filled to A.</p>

<p>This having been done, let a tube be taken,
open at both ends E F; and of such a length that
A C : E F &gt; 2 L : G + L; and the orifice F
stopped, or rather filled with a filter or some substance
separating the lighter fluid from the
heavier (as is possible also by Hyp. 5); when the
tube filled in this manner with fluid is immersed
to the bottom of the vessel C D; I say that the
fluid will continually ascend by the orifice of the
tube F, and by the orifice E will fall into the fluid
below.</p>

<h4><i>Demonstration</i></h4>

<p>Because the orifice of the tube F is occupied
by a filter (by Constr.) which separates the
lighter fluid from the heavier; it follows, that if
the tube be immersed to the bottom of the vessel,
the fluid lighter by itself, which is mixed with the
heavier fluid, must ascend in the tube, and as it
will ascend above the surface of the surrounding
fluid as A C : E F = 2 L : G + L : which is (by
Const.) A C : E F &gt; 2 L : G + L, it necessarily
follows (by Hyp. 3) that the lighter liquid,
through the orifice E, will fall in the vessel below;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
there it again mixes with the heavier (by Hyp.
4); and then, penetrating the filter, ascends again
into the tube, and escapes by the upper orifice.
So, therefore, the flow is continued perpetually.&mdash;Q. E. D.</p>

<h4><i>Corollary</i></h4>

<p>Hence a reason may easily be given, why
water from the depths of the ocean, ascending
into the summits of the mountains, bursts from
them in the form of rivers and flows again into
the ocean; so does Nature offer to us the spectacle
of perpetual motion.</p>

<p>Hence I say, they do not well explain who
allege that the water ascends to these heights
through the pores of the earth, as a fluid ascends
in narrow tubes above the surface of the fluid surrounding;
for if such were the explanation of the
thing, they would never be able to demonstrate
it; for the water so raised to a height from the
bosom of the earth, falls again, whereas we see
that the fluid in these narrow tubes, although
slightly elevated above the surrounding surface,
never issues from their orifices and falls into the
fluid below. The following is then the more
feasible explanation. It is known that water in
which much salt is held in solution is heavier than
fresh water; now sea-water, as is sufficiently evident
from the taste, contains many saline particles;
consequently it is heavier than spring or
river water; so that it is credible that the earth
acts like a filter through the pores of which only
fresh water can pass, the saline particles being
left behind, and this increases the weight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
water; the fresh water must ascend much higher
on account of the immense profundity of the
ocean, as it is forced to the highest peaks of the
mountains by the presence of the sea-water; and
thence, not being able to ascend any higher, it
falls in rivers.</p></blockquote>

<h3>P. Christopher Scheiner</h3>

<p>That an earnest belief in the possibility of
Perpetual Motion has not been confined entirely
to scientific tyros and enthusiastic dreamers, is
sufficiently attested by the fact that a respectable
number of eminent scientists, many of whom had
done great service in their scientific labors, have
believed in such possibility.</p>

<p>Among these is to be mentioned P. Christopher
Scheiner, a German, born 1575, and died
1650. He was a mechanic of note; in his day
made valuable additions to what was known of
light and optics, invented the Pantagraph, discovered
solar spots, besides benefiting mankind
by many other distinguished fruits of his genius.</p>

<p>The subject of Perpetual Motion claimed
some of his attention. He wrote in defense of its
possibility. The substance of what he said, translated
into English, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let the centre of the universe then, or of
gravity, be A, and the gnomon A B C, of which
the extremity A is pierced and traversed by an
axis going through the centre of the world, so
that it may turn and revolve freely and easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
around the said centre; to the other extremity
of the gnomon, C, let a phial full of water be
attached.</p>

<p>The weight C will turn around the centre A
and will first come to D, thence to E, thence to F
and G; then it will return
to C, having described a
complete circle, C D E F G;
then it will again move to
D, E, F, etc., and so perpetually,
since there is no
reason for its stopping in
any point of the circle rather
than in another.</p>

<div id="if_i_342" class="figleft" style="width: 129px;"><img src="images/i_342.jpg" width="129" height="129" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>That indeed the weight
C affixed to the gnomon will move from C to D,
is proved by daily experience, by which it is established
that a gnomon so contrived and placed
erect on any flat space, will not be able to stand,
but the arm B C, C preponderating, will move
towards D.</p>

<p>It may in the second place be proved, that if,
on the other hand, another arm B G be added to
the gnomon, equal in weight and similar to the
other, the whole G B C A will remain motionless
in equilibrium; therefore the arm B G being
taken away and equilibrium being destroyed,
the arm B C must move in the opposite direction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above, from Scheiner, called forth the
following from Schott, who was also an eminent
mathematician:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whether there could be a perpetual artificial
motion around the centre of the earth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<div id="if_i_343" class="figleft" style="width: 181px;"><img src="images/i_343.jpg" width="181" height="248" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>We have treated this question in our Hydraulico-pneumatic
Mechanics, Part 2, Class 2,
Machine 13, not however universally, but only in
one particular case,
that of the Gnomon
of Scheiner. For P.
Christopher Scheiner,
in "Mathematical
Disquisitions,"
in Number XV., Corollary
4, asserts
Perpetual Artificial
Motion not to be repugnant
to Nature,
and attempts to prove
it in the following
manner. Let a
gnomon of a certain
weight A B C be suspended
around A, the
centre of the universe, and bound to the beam D
F, which is supported by the columns D F and
E G and turns at the pole D or E; or let it be fixed
at the poles, but the gnomon revolving at A.</p>

<p>These being the conditions, I say that the
gnomon A B C will revolve from C to H and towards
I, thence will return to C, thence to H as
before, and so on perpetually. The cause of this
continual motion is the forcible suspension; for
the whole gnomon preponderates in C on account
of the perpendicular tangent B A; which effect
becomes more marked if a globe of iron S be supposed
suspended at C. As therefore the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
this mass, as well from the supports of the balance
as from the momentary diameter, hangs suspended
at C, and the vertex A, on account of the
firm beam D E, cannot fall from the centre of the
universe; it comes to pass that all points as well
of the globe S, as of the gnomon A B C, with a
continual motion turn round A; but because, by
the line B A in the fixed point A, they are held
from falling to the centre; therefore the greatest
force of that tendency is exerted in the line B,
and induces it to inclination; which inclination on
account of the continuous solidity of the gnomon
cannot be at all abated, so that the whole impetus
is exerted either at the point A about the movable
beam or at the movable poles of the beam D and
E; which poles being free in their sockets D and
E, abandon themselves to the motion of Nature,
and thus do not in any wise hinder a perpetual
circular motion. What indeed is self-evident in
this, reason confirms, and daily experience in
statics manifests. For if a short gnomon stand
either on the terrestrial superficies M N, O P, or
Q R; it will always fall towards the part C, or N,
by the preponderating portion M K C; which is
manifested in daily experiments.</p>

<p>Thence it is evident that if the gnomon were
entire, the force which it exerts at N would pass
into the line B A still hanging over the centre.
And this is one argument. The other is from the
contrary. For if an equal and similar gnomon
were attached towards the part D, then the whole
mass hanging on its centre would remain in
equilibrium and there would be no motion; consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
the one half being taken away, the other
would necessarily move according to the laws and
experience of statics. If the shortened gnomon
M B C N were bound only to the point M, the rest
being left free, it would certainly revolve, and in
the same case, the point C would describe almost
a semicircular arc till, coming down to a perpendicular
position, it would there remain.</p>

<p>Now as the force of the entire gnomon falls
in the vertex A, there would be an entire and perpetual
revolution around A. Much more would
this be the case if on the centre C stood either the
small curve A C L A or the larger one A K C,
or finally the globe S alone, hanging from two
iron rods A B and B C, or from one arc, A N C.
From this, therefore, it may be demonstrated that
a perpetual circular motion is possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1825, the following was contributed to
and published in "Mechanics' Magazine." We
are unable to give the name of the contributor,
but he writes in encouragement of Perpetual Motion.
The gist of his article is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We can now, however, soar above the clouds,
explore the depths of the ocean, and skim over its
surface. * * * And be it remembered that
we owe these and many other advantages to a
few persevering individuals who were, in all
probability, stigmatized as chimerical visionaries
by those who seem to have an unconquerable propensity
to condemn everything above the level of
their own understanding.</p>

<p>If by perpetual motion nothing more is meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
than the putting in motion some of the most
durable substances with which we are acquainted,
in such a manner as to ensure a continuance of
motion as long as those substances will resist the
effects of time and friction, I do not despair of
seeing it accomplished. * * * [He thinks
there is] reasonable ground to hope that the time
is not far distant when even this impossibility
must yield to persevering ingenuity. In the present
state of public opinion with regard to its practicability,
it would be looked upon as an empty
boast, were I to assert that the discovery is already
made.</p></blockquote>

<h3>T. H. Pasley</h3>

<p>T. H. Pasley in 1824, contributed an article
to "Mechanics' Magazine," asserting the possibility
of Perpetual Motion. The following excerpts
give the substance of his article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I feel no hesitation in standing up in support
of this grand desideratum,&mdash;this almost forsaken
friend of science,&mdash;whether the thing be practicable
or not.</p>

<p>On the contrary, "Persevere" should be
every one's advice; to do so, or discontinue, every
one's own pleasure. And why should the impossibility
of anything be pronounced unless it be established
wherein the limits of possibility consist?</p>

<p>It is puerile in the extreme to be foretelling
defeat when so many other objects may be gained
by the highly laudable pursuit, perhaps of greater
advantage to society at large than the discovery
in question. * * * In a word, were the perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
motion discovered tomorrow, it would be
wise of all the governments of the world to offer
a very high reward for some species of discovery
that would be universally sought after, although
it might never be found out. * * * The
effects of industry are&mdash;enlargement of the mind,
accumulation of knowledge, and rendering ourselves
ignorant of the torments which idleness
and dulness always engender. * * * In the
next place, there are no solid grounds for the assertion
that the discovery of a perpetual motion
is an impossibility. In the present state of human
knowledge respecting the powers of nature, it is
not demonstrable one way or another. * * *
The study of what relates to the perpetual motion
has this great advantage, that it directs to the
discovery of error as well as of truth; whereas,
what are they which are called truths of science
at present but vacillating human opinions, or
erroneous assumptions of what we call natural
causes? What are they but such as consist in
mere assumption, sanctioned by time, and admitted
by existing authorities in science, and of
course generally acquiesced in, without previous
investigation?</p>

<p>So far, then, from being guided in our decision
respecting what is possible by the "unerring
laws of nature," by "mathematical demonstration,"
and by "experimental proofs," we are continually
misled by an erroneous faith in the nonentity,
attraction.</p>

<p>On such an imperfect knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
causes of phenomena, who should say he knows
what can or what cannot be discovered?</p></blockquote>

<h3>Article From Pamphleteer</h3>

<p>In the "Pamphleteer," published in London,
the following by a correspondent whose name we
cannot give was published in March of 1822:</p>

<p>"A few words inducing towards the discovery
of Perpetual Motion, perhaps the actual discovery
thereof:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
London, March, 1822.<br />
</p>

<p>What is meant by the term "Perpetual Motion?"
Is it supposed that there is an undiscovered
substance in the world, that will of itself
perpetually move, with as little apparent cause as
that which actuates the needle in becoming motionless
in one particular position? Or, is it to
be found in the combined reaction of mechanical
powers?</p>

<p>The first idea is stamped with a degree of
probability, by the mystery of the needle; yet I
imagine the latter is relied on with the greater
confidence of mankind, and is the pith of the
following few words:</p>

<p>It is well known that the weight of a pendulum
will almost regain the level from which it descended,
losing a little space at every vibration,
until it becomes motionless; if of itself it could
exceed or even regain the level, doubtless it would
become a perpetual motion.</p>

<p>To find a power that will aid the motion of
the pendulum, and in conjunction renew its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
strength, is what is wanted to create perpetual
motion.</p>

<p>What I shall endeavor to explain will at least
induce towards the discovery of this power.</p>

<p>The principal parts of the machinery about
to be shown are in number three:</p>

<p>A vibrating pendulum.</p>

<p>A revolving pendulum, and</p>

<p>A tubular lever.</p>

<p>A vibrating pendulum in motion describes a
segment of a circle, and returns on the same segment,
and at every vibration its described segment
decreases.</p>

<p>A revolving pendulum is composed of two or
more pendulums, united at their lighter extremities,
there revolving on an axis, the heavier extremities
being placed at equal distances in the
outer circle: this, I believe, is what is termed a
fly-wheel when affixed to hand-mills, etc.</p>

<p>The tubular lever is the chief instigator of
the whole, and must contain a weight apportioned
to the weights of the two pendulums.</p>

<p>Fix the lever on a cross axis; thus, on an
axis within a circle, the circle on an axis at opposite
angles, thereby is given to each extremity of
the lever a revolving power of motion; attach one
extremity of the lever to the outer circle of a
revolving pendulum, the other extremity confine
within the bar of the vibrating pendulum; thus
combined, the effect to be produced when put in
motion will be this:</p>

<p>The two pendulums will guide the motion of
the lever, which then partakes of the power of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
pendulum, giving fresh impulse at every vibration
of the pendulum, and every half revolution of the
revolving pendulum; for, as each extremity of
the lever rises, the weight within falls to the
opposite extremity, and gives fresh impulse to the
whole: thus (if my idea is correct) will be produced
motion perpetual&mdash;that is to say, perpetual
so long as the materials of which it is made will
hold together. I have given this short description
merely by way of example, as I believe there
are several ways of combining these three powers,
so as to produce perpetual motion, if my idea on
the subject is correct.</p>

<p>The lever may contain mercury or a solid orb
of heavy substance; and if the tube be exhausted
of air the weight will pass more freely, and certainly
increase the power of the lever.</p></blockquote>

<h3>J. Welch</h3>

<p>In 1825 the following article was published
in "Mechanics' Magazine," having been contributed
by J. Welch:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those who condemn the notion altogether
seem to have taken but a very confined view of
the subject. What they say about mere matter is
right enough; but they seem to forget that there
are other active agents in nature which possess
wonderful powers, that have nothing to do with
either bulk, weight, or form. Such are electricity,
magnetic attraction, capillary attraction, and the
irregular pressure of the atmosphere. The
powers of electricity are great, and, indeed, it
seems to be the <i>primum mobile</i> that gives life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
motion to the animated part of the creation. Dr.
Franklin shows us how to give a circular coated
plate, revolving on an axle, sufficient power to
roast a chicken, merely by once changing (charging?)
it. Could not a plate of this kind be made
to turn a small electrical apparatus, so situated as
to keep the charge in the plate always at its
maximum? The whole might be kept dry by having
it enclosed in a glass case.</p>

<p>It has often been attempted to give motion to
a wheel by the power of a loadstone, but hitherto
without effect; no substance in nature being
found to have the power, by interposition, of cutting
off its attractive property. Still I think it
should be further investigated. Is a small piece
of steel in the form of a wedge as strongly attracted
at the smaller end as at the thicker? And
would not twenty or thirty pieces of steel, of that
form, placed round the circumference of a circle,
the point of one towards the head of the other,
cause a magnet placed in the centre, to revolve in
the direction in which their points lie? I think,
perhaps not; but still such experiments should be
tried.</p>

<p>In capillary attraction we have a power that
at once raises fluids above their level. It is this
which carries the oil up the wick of a lamp as fast
as the flame consumes it. Water and other fluids
rise through cotton even quicker than oil; and he
who can contrive to collect them as they arrive at
the top will discover perpetual motion. Would
not water run constantly through a siphon, one
leg of which was made of a collection of capillary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
tubes, and the other in the usual way? or would
the water above and below the tubes neutralize
and destroy their power?</p>

<p>I now come to the pressure of the atmosphere,
a thing easily understood. * * * Make
a cast-iron barometrical tube, with a top sufficiently
large to contain 2 cwt. of mercury; invert
it in a basin large enough to contain 2 or 3 cwt.
more, and let a piece of iron of 10 or 12 stones
weight float on the mercury in this basin, so as to
rise and fall along with it at every change of the
weather. We have here both motion and power.
The motion, indeed, will sometimes stand still,
but then it can easily be regulated, and made a
constant quantity in the machine to be attached.
I have no doubt but clocks, etc., may be made to
derive their chiming principle from a contrivance
of this nature.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Article From Mechanics' Magazine</h3>

<p>In 1831, the following article was contributed
by an unknown correspondent to, and
published in "Mechanics' Magazine":</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">
"Yes; we shall conquer! All those dangers past<br />
Will serve to enrich the future story."<br />
</p>

<p>The application to the subject, on my part,
has been accompanied by continual experimental
elucidations of the subjects considered, and comparisons
of these with the axioms, theorems, and
demonstrations of one of the best authorities, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
may be allowed so to call my favorite author,
Emerson, whose <i>I says</i> are generally correct.</p>

<p>I disagree with Mr. B., and do trust that even
a perpetual motion seeker might deserve encouragement,
if it be found that such a character
may exist in a person who is not so ignorant of
first principles as Mr. B. supposes <i>all</i> are who
have this bias; especially if it be found that the
person's researches have been connected with
subjects of a more tangible nature, relating to the
improvement of the useful arts, and particularly
to some modern inventions of high importance
that are not perfectly correct in their construction.</p>

<p>In this article, Mr. B. advises those who are
misspending their time in this pursuit, to consider
the question in its most simple form, divested of
more complicated operations, which simple form
is that of a pulley accurately constructed so as to
reduce the resistance to motion as much as possible.
He says, "it will be found, as long as the
weights are equal," there will be no motion produced,
but wherever the weights are placed they
will remain; and to produce vertical motion in
the smallest degree, it will be necessary to add a
weight to one of the former to create a preponderancy.
This weight he calls the mechanical loss,
and an insurmountable bar to perpetual motion,
etc. We need not follow Mr. B. to his conclusion,
as I think this insurmountable bar can be easily
removed; and I shall be able to show that this
equilibrium, for such it merely is, can be destroyed
without adding to one of the weights, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
absolutely taking from the other; though this
may virtually be considered to be the case, inasmuch
as we can at least produce an effect on the
system as if the weight were reduced. Mr. B.
says, under this arrangement, "wherever the
weights are placed they will remain, unless an
addition is made to one of them." We will therefore
suppose the following diagram to represent
the arrangement on a small scale, delicately constructed.</p>

<div id="if_i_354" class="figleft" style="width: 64px;"><img src="images/i_354.jpg" width="64" height="246" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>A B are the two weights connected
to each other by the string
passing over the pulley, and being
nicely equalized in their weight,
here would, of course, be an equilibrium
on the principle of the lever.
But take a flat piece of wood, such
as a ruler, and place it obliquely in
a way so as not to interfere with
the pulley <i>m</i> in the direction <i>d</i>, and
then bring the weight to impinge
upon it in a way so as not to move
the weight A <i>m</i>, C <i>d</i>, the least, or
alter its position. What will be the
consequence? Some would say,
why, the weight A would then descend,
and cause the weight B to
ascend. But I should rather say, the reaction of
the plane when acted on by the weight B, having
destroyed the equilibrium of the forces, motion
takes place. Now, if we attribute this motion to
the reaction of the plane on the weight, though
we will not go so far as to say motion is generated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
yet if we say, by this simple arrangement
the equilibrium is destroyed and motion takes
place, the least we can admit is, that motion is
communicated to the system, and that by the
agency of part of the machine itself, the apparatus
employed being considered as such. Then,
why so much objection to the term self-moving
machine in limited sense? But I will not dispute
about words, which are but the images of things,
and images may be strangely distorted by the
medium through which they are received&mdash;of
which distorting mediums, there is none equal to
that of prejudice in favor of abstract notions&mdash;which
notions perhaps, if rigidly examined, would
be found to have no foundation in facts or in
common sense.</p>

<p>Another demonstrator of the impossibility
of perpetual motion, is Mr. Mackinnon (see "Mechanical
Magazine," Vol. 1, Page 363). As
no doubt the different attempts to produce, or
communicate, continued and perpetual motion, at
least, such as are often brought forward by persons
unacquainted with the science of mechanics,
are generally to those who are acquainted with
that science, if not absolutely ridiculous, yet of a
nature to excite a smile at their futility: still
there are a few (perhaps a very few) who entertain
an opinion that such a thing is not impracticable,
and who have, from practical experience
as well as study, acquired a tolerable insight into
the laws of nature (so far as relate to this subject);
who in their turn cannot help smiling at
the weak reasoning of some other would-be philosophers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
who gravely give their dictum in the
case. In this class I include Mr. Mackinnon, who
very gravely goes to work to prove, etc., and flatters
himself he shall, if rightly understood, help
to prevent much future waste of time on the subject.
He then goes on to give us his definition of
inertia, by which he informs us that a body in a
state of rest will remain so until it is moved
(wonderful!)&mdash;that it cannot move itself&mdash;that
it has not that power&mdash;and that no mechanical
contrivance can give it that power. (How profound!)</p></blockquote>
